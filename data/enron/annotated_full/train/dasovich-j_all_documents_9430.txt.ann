I'm thinking that Sean \nain't even a big food person, that he's not working, that Molly to bring down \na king's ransom in her biz, and Tom and Karen are, after all, vegetarians.  \nAnywho,  it's really kind of you guys to want to go there, but I'm just \nthrowing out the notion that maybe we should go to another place that's just \na wee bit less dear.  Maybe that other French place that's just one room that \nwe went to out in the Avenues.  Just a thought.  Whatever you guys want to do \nis fine with me.\n\nAlso, I'm happy to do a \"whole family\" thing----well, maybe \"happy's to \nstrong\" (we kid!).  I was actually trying to pull it together last Xmas, but \nfound out that my sister and her hubbie only do their big xmas party once a \nyear, so had to scratch it.  I ain't necessarily all that keen, though, on \nhaving all get together--particularly for the first time--with the focus \nbeing my birthday.  So maybe we can have another event sometime soon where we \ncan bring the thundering hoards together at one place----Lord help us.\n\nFinally, what's the plan for your dad?  I just found out that I'm supposed to \nbe in Houston for an \"all hands\" meeting on--you guessed it--March 9th, but \nif there's something planned for that evening, I intend to tell my buddies at \nEnron that I can't make the meeting.  Please let me know so that I can cancel \nHouston in advance.\n\nFinally, and MOST important.  Today is the Man in Black's birthday.  God \nbless the real king, Johnny Cash.\n\nBest,\nJeff",

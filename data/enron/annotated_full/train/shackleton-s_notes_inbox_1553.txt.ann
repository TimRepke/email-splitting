Further, I note from \nyour CAS analysis that the most recent financial statements you had available \nwere year end 1998.  Did we request more current data from Vitol?  Did Vitol \ndecline this request?  \n\nWe have a teleconference scheduled with their attorney at 10am Houston time \ntomorrow (Tuesday).  If you can shoot me a response to these questions before \nthen, I would appreciate it.  If not, please get back to me at your earliest \nconvenience.\n\nThanks,\nPaul",

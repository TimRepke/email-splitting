It's the Westinghouse 501D5A.  The good news is, is that this from a commercial point of view is being looked after so there are no external issues to worry about - just allocation issues.\n\nI would propose that we notify the accountants of the following:-\n\nENA to assume the nominal cost of the turbine as of Jan 1, '01, exclusive of carrying costs up to that date. From Jan 1 forward ENA will assume full responsibility for any carrying costs, and any continuing payment obligations under the purchase contract with Westinghouse.\nThe nominal cost of the turbine as of Jan 1, '01 exclusive of carrying costs, is $22,947,599. This is the amount that we propose ENA to assume with \trespect to the turbine. \nThe carrying cost through Jan 1 to be assumed by CALME/EGA is $2,055,330. This amount reflects the actual carrying charges imposed by Enron Corp on \tCALME/EGA based upon the payments made to Westinghouse under the purchase agreement.\nThe continuing payment obligation to be assumed by ENA under the purchase contract with Westinghouse is $1,558,401. This amount reflects the actual final payment due under the contract, which is due at commercial operations.\n\nI think that does it and should clear up the accounting issues and Wes can then deal with sorting out the allocations.\n\n(Wes please sort out unless Jim has any problems with the above methodology).\n\nThanks\n\nLouise\n\n",

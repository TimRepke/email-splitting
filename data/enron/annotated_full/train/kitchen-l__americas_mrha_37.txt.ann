I felt that the meeting was very informative and that discussions between Enron and Marathon have progressed in a constructive manner to broach a potential asset management outsourcing arrangement.  \n\nAs promised during the meeting, I have attached Enron's Confidentiality / Non-disclosure agreement. Enron's appropriate legal contact for further questions or comments regarding this document would be Mr. Gerald Nemec.  He can be reached at (713) 853-3512.\n\nAfter the Confidentiality Agreement is signed, I look forward to delivering a proposal for the above mentioned commercial arrangement.\n\nIf I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to call.  I can be reached at (713) 853-1931.\n\nRegards,\n\nJean \n\n\n ",

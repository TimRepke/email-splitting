Because history teaches us that whatever  \nhappens to California -- smog, road rage, tofu, coffee that is mainly air, \ncell  phones, the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive, Shirley \nMacLaine,  people taking in-line skating seriously, grandmothers sporting new \nand  flagrantly inappropriate bosoms -- eventually happens to the rest of the \nnation.  Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage \nand see if  we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and \nchange the  subject.  \n\nOur first question is: What, exactly, is electricity? When we look in our  \nMicrosoft Encarta encyclopedia, we see that \"electricity\" is defined  as a \n\"class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge  and from \nthe interaction of charges.\" What does this mean, in lay-person's  terms?  \n\nIt means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big, fat  \ndope. Because we know from our junior-high-school science training that  \nelectricity is actually a fast-moving herd of electrons, which are tiny  \none-celled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside \na  double-A battery, where they die within minutes.  \n\nElectrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited. This was  \nproved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during \na  thunderstorm and was almost killed. Encouraged by this success, Franklin \nwent on  to conduct many more electrical experiments, including rolling a \nhoop in a  thunderstorm, playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing \nsomersaults in a  thunderstorm.  \n\nFinally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister  \nPooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm, leaving the authorities with no \nchoice  but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France.  Nevertheless, \nFranklin had proved an important scientific point, which is  that electricity \noriginates inside clouds. There it forms into lightning, which  is attracted \nto the earth by golfers.  \n\nAfter entering the ground, the electricity hardens into coal, which, when \ndug  up by power companies and burned in big ovens called \"generators,\"  \nturns back into electricity, which is sent in the form of \"volts\"  (also \nknown as \"watts,\" or \"rpm\" for short) through special  wires with birds \nsitting on them to consumers' homes, where it is transformed by  TV sets into \ncommercials for beer, which passes through the consumers and back  into the \nground, thus completing what is known as a \"circuit.\"  \n\nBut enough technical talk. The problem is that California is running out of  \nelectricity. The situation is so bad that in some hospitals, they don't have  \nenough electricity to power those electric-shock paddles that get people's  \nhearts started again; instead, the doctors and nurses have to hold hands, \nscuff  their feet across the carpet in unison, then shout \"CLEAR!\" as they  \ntouch the patient's chest.  \n\nWho is responsible for California's electricity shortage? You could blame \nthe  power companies; or you could blame environmental wackos; or you could \nblame the  entertainment industry, which uses more than 750 billion watts of \nelectricity  per day just to blow-dry the hair of the cast of Dawson's Creek; \nor you  could blame (why not?) the Firestone tire company. But you would be \nwrong.  Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity \nshortage is:  college students.  \n\nI base this statement on widespread observation of my son, who is a college  \nstudent, and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium. If my son \nis  in a room, then every electrical device within 200 yards of that room -- \nevery  light, computer, television, stereo, video game, microwave oven, etc. \n-- will be  running. My son doesn't even have to turn the devices on; they \nactivate  themselves spontaneously in response to his presence.  \n\nNow take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in  \nCalifornia, which according to my research is (EDITOR: Please insert number \nof  college students in California) and you see my point, which is (EDITOR: \nPlease  insert my point).  \n\nThe question is: What can the rest of us do to help our fellow \ncountrypersons  in California? The answer is that we can send them our spare \nelectricity. Just  imagine what would happen if all the households in this \ngreat and generous  nation got out their extension cords and connected them \ntogether, forming a  giant electrical \"chain of helping\" across the fruited \nplain to the  Golden State! Millions of people would be turned into generous \nsmoking lumps of  carbon, that's what. So maybe we should go with Plan B. \nThis involves building a  really, really, really big kite.  \n\nKnight-Ridder Tribune  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "\n\nFeb. 2, 2001, 8:06PM\n\nThe rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite \n\nBy DAVE BARRY  \n\nWhen we consider the serious electricity shortage in California, our  \nreaction, as concerned Americans, is: Ha ha!  \n\nNo, seriously, we are alarmed. Because history teaches us that whatever  \nhappens to California -- smog, road rage, tofu, coffee that is mainly air, \ncell  phones, the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive, Shirley \nMacLaine,  people taking in-line skating seriously, grandmothers sporting new \nand  flagrantly inappropriate bosoms -- eventually happens to the rest of the \nnation.  Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage \nand see if  we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and \nchange the  subject.  \n\nOur first question is: What, exactly, is electricity? When we look in our  \nMicrosoft Encarta encyclopedia, we see that \"electricity\" is defined  as a \n\"class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge  and from \nthe interaction of charges.\" What does this mean, in lay-person's  terms?  \n\nIt means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big, fat  \ndope. Because we know from our junior-high-school science training that  \nelectricity is actually a fast-moving herd of electrons, which are tiny  \none-celled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside \na  double-A battery, where they die within minutes.  \n\nElectrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited. This was  \nproved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during \na  thunderstorm and was almost killed. Encouraged by this success, Franklin \nwent on  to conduct many more electrical experiments, including rolling a \nhoop in a  thunderstorm, playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing \nsomersaults in a  thunderstorm.  \n\nFinally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister  \nPooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm, leaving the authorities with no \nchoice  but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France.  Nevertheless, \nFranklin had proved an important scientific point, which is  that electricity \noriginates inside clouds. There it forms into lightning, which  is attracted \nto the earth by golfers.  \n\nAfter entering the ground, the electricity hardens into coal, which, when \ndug  up by power companies and burned in big ovens called \"generators,\"  \nturns back into electricity, which is sent in the form of \"volts\"  (also \nknown as \"watts,\" or \"rpm\" for short) through special  wires with birds \nsitting on them to consumers' homes, where it is transformed by  TV sets into \ncommercials for beer, which passes through the consumers and back  into the \nground, thus completing what is known as a \"circuit.\"  \n\nBut enough technical talk. The problem is that California is running out of  \nelectricity. The situation is so bad that in some hospitals, they don't have  \nenough electricity to power those electric-shock paddles that get people's  \nhearts started again; instead, the doctors and nurses have to hold hands, \nscuff  their feet across the carpet in unison, then shout \"CLEAR!\" as they  \ntouch the patient's chest.  \n\nWho is responsible for California's electricity shortage? You could blame \nthe  power companies; or you could blame environmental wackos; or you could \nblame the  entertainment industry, which uses more than 750 billion watts of \nelectricity  per day just to blow-dry the hair of the cast of Dawson's Creek; \nor you  could blame (why not?) the Firestone tire company. But you would be \nwrong.  Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity \nshortage is:  college students.  \n\nI base this statement on widespread observation of my son, who is a college  \nstudent, and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium. If my son \nis  in a room, then every electrical device within 200 yards of that room -- \nevery  light, computer, television, stereo, video game, microwave oven, etc. \n-- will be  running. My son doesn't even have to turn the devices on; they \nactivate  themselves spontaneously in response to his presence.  \n\nNow take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in  \nCalifornia, which according to my research is (EDITOR: Please insert number \nof  college students in California) and you see my point, which is (EDITOR: \nPlease  insert my point).  \n\nThe question is: What can the rest of us do to help our fellow \ncountrypersons  in California? The answer is that we can send them our spare \nelectricity. Just  imagine what would happen if all the households in this \ngreat and generous  nation got out their extension cords and connected them \ntogether, forming a  giant electrical \"chain of helping\" across the fruited \nplain to the  Golden State! Millions of people would be turned into generous \nsmoking lumps of  carbon, that's what. So maybe we should go with Plan B. \nThis involves building a  really, really, really big kite.  \n\nKnight-Ridder Tribune  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

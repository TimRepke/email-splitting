It will help to clarify a few issues.\n \n1. I was contacted by Christian (this means I did not start this phase of the process)\n    last Friday, as far as I can remember.\n \n    Christian expressed interest in joining the Research Group. I told him two things:\n       a. We would be delighted to have him here.\n       b. Our mutual relationship and good practices require that he receives\n           your blessing before we can move ahead.\n    We agreed to have a conference call Wed morning, your time, with you, Christian and\n    Mike Roberts.\n \n  2. Wednesday call was subsequently cancelled by Christian. Mike and I decided to call you\n      anyway Thu morning your time, directly, to discuss the matter. I was in a PRC all afternoon and \n      asked Mike to call you  in case I could not sneak out to join him. Mike called and was\n      told you were out sick.\n \n 3. I am leaving in a few hours for California. I shall be driving back to Houston for the next\n     3 days. Please, feel free to call Mike an discuss this matter with  him in my absence.\n \n 4. I think Christian has a strong preference to be in the Research Group, assuming he moves to\n     Houston. I think he came to this conclusion after visiting Houston in early July. I did not \n     bring up the issue of transfer with him at all when he was here.\n \n     I can  understand his motivation and think we should take his preferences into account. But the\n     first  issue is if he can leave Sydney at all.\n \nI hope it helps. Cheers.\n \n \nVince\n \n    \n \n \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Quilkey, Paul \nSent: Thursday, July 19, 2001 4:08 AM\nTo: Kaminski, Vince J\nSubject: Christian\n\n\nVince\n \nI have spoken to Christian and explained to him that he is critical to our local operations and should provide 100% focus on his role here.

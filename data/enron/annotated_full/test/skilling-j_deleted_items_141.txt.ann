The new SBSC\nreport provides a wealth of energy facts; a history of U.S. energy policy; a\nsober assessment of global warming and related proposed policies; a look at\nwhat has gone wrong in states like California; and an assessment of the Bush\nadministration's energy proposals.\n\n \"Our energy crisis today is not about a looming depletion of energy\nresources, threatened destruction of the environment, wasteful consumers,\ngreedy energy companies, or even OPEC.  Instead, we are experiencing a\ncrisis of misguided government rules, regulations, and taxes that have\nendangered consumers, businesses of every size and type, U.S.\ncompetitiveness, and the economy,\" said SBSC chief economist Raymond J.\nKeating, author of the SBSC report entitled \"Energy Freedom: Lifting\nGovernment Burdens on U.S. Energy Producers & Consumers.\"\n\n\"Nothing is more crucial to the future of the economy and survival of small\nbusinesses than a successful energy policy,\" said SBSC president Darrell\nMcKigney.  \"Our goal in this report is to show that providing relief from\nregulatory restrictions and red tape, expanding energy exploration and\ndevelopment, and reducing international trade barriers are the real keys to\nsuccessful energy plan.\"\n\nThe complete 40 page \"Energy Freedom: Lifting Government Burdens on U.S.\nEnergy Producers & Consumers\" is the latest report in SBSC's \"21st Century\nSmall Business Policy Series,\" and can be downloaded from the group's\nwebsite at www.sbsc.org,  or you can request a printed copy by calling\nPriscilla Tacujan at (202) 785-0238.\n\nAuthor Ray Keating is available for interviews, as is SBSC President Darrell\nMcKigney.\n\nSBSC is a leading national nonprofit, nonpartisan small business advocacy\ngroup headquartered in Washington, D.C.

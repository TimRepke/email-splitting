As this piece makes\nclear, these crises of capacity and delivery of electricity around the\nnation are doomed to continue for a simple reason:  electricity is a new\ngame, still being played under old rules. It is becoming a competitive\nmarket, but the old rules written for a government-sanctioned monopoly market \nhaven't been\nupdated.\n\nAs a result, some old-line utilities are exploiting and even contributing to\nthe crises with behavior that is not controlled by the old rules. As the\nstory details, utilities can drive prices up, exacerbate the energy shortage\nby withholding electricity from the grid, or impede the free flow of\nelectricity across lines they control.  It's gamesmanship, very profitable\nand not illegal, but definitely not in the public interest.\n\nThere is a very simple fix to the problem.  Write new rules.  Some old\nlaws need to be repealed. Some new oversight over this interstate commodity\nhas to be given the Federal government so that the general welfare gains\nsome control over local profiteering.  There are bills in Congress that make\nthese fixes. But a few powerful utilities block their passage. As long as\nthis blockade remains in effect, the industry cannot move forward to\nmodernize itself, build new generating capacity, and streamline the way\nelectricity moves from region to region.  Some day, Congress will pass the\nneeded legislation. Why not now?\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\nBill Paxon\nNational Chairman\nAmericans for Affordable Electricity\n",

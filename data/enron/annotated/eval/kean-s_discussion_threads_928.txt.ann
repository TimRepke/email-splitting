In fact,  appears that E Power has been \npursuing this prospect on a smaller scly, but nothing has progressed to high \nlevel management or board approval.\n\n\n\n\nWe are in the process of providing interviews and responding to inquiries \nfrom major Japanese media and others.  These inquiries have been in \nanticipation of the March 21 partial liberalization of the Japanese power \nsector.  These discussions also are being utilized to confirm that Enron will \nbe opening a merchant office in Japan.  This is in addition to the EnCom/E \nPower affiliate, which is focused on industrial power generation.  Attached \nare the Q&As we are using in response to media inquiries.\n\n\n ",

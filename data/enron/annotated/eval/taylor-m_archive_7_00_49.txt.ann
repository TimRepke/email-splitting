After some hearty belly-laughing at his expense flowing from \nthe rich comedic theme of how we talk so sweet to our customers on the phone \nand then hang up and curse their mortal souls with expletives deleted,    I  \nagreed with him that we need to ask the following question to those above \nwith more wisdom than we have:\n\nWhen you do the physical leg of an EFP transaction,  must the delivery point \nfor the physical piece be identical to the delivery point of the futures \npiece?  \n\nShooting from the hip on the Casino floor without much substantive \nexplanation to go on, I said the answer to this question was absolutely yes \nand the City of Vernon huffed and puffed and said they had done other deals \nwhere the delivery points were different.\n\nI made us document the deal as follows:\n\n1. An undocumented Nymex transaction whereby our broker agreed with their \nbroker that we would buy 30 Palo Verde futures contracts from Vernon for $120.\n\n2. Then, the Exchange of this futures position for a physical position was \ndocumented as a physical trade whereby EPMI sold Vernon 30 MW at Palo Verde \nfor $120.\n\n3. Then, because Vernon wanted to get out of their Palo Verde position, we \nagreed to buy back the 30 Mw for $120 and this was documented as a phsical \ntransaction.\n\n4.  Then, because Vernon needed the power at NP-15, we sold them 30 MW at \nNP-15 for $116. (Don't get distracted by thinking about buying at $120 and \nselling at $116 and losing money. The prices were good at both points as part \nof our portfolio of deals.)  \n\nVernon said we should have done step 1 and step 4 and not 2 and 3 and that \nthey do this all the time.  I basically said that if the delivery point in \nthe NYMEX contract was PV that it had to be the same in the physical part of \nthe EFP.   May we please have the benefit of any comments on this issue.  \nThank you kindly.----cgy\n",

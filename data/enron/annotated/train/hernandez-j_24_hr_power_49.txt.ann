  "text": "Dear Juan,\n\nFriedWire Inc is pleased to announce the release of the California ISO module \nin our Traffic Report System.  With the\ninformation in the CA ISO module you'll be able to quickly assess the supply \nand demand fundamentals that drive market\ndecisions in the Western grid.  The real time information in the CA ISO \nmodule is incorporated into easy to read graphs,\ncharts and custom interactive maps.  Below is a snapshot of the new content:\n\nCALIFORNIA ISO MODULE OVERVIEW\n         Frequency Monitoring in WSCC (deviation from 60Hz)\n         Real-time California ISO loads for today, two weeks, month and year\n         Congestion Prices in California\n                -10 Minute Expost Incremental & Decremental Prices\n                -Hour Ending Expost Prices\n                -Hour Ahead Congestion Prices\n                -Day Ahead Congestion Prices\n         Day Ahead Congestion Price Summary\n         Congestion Zone Profiles\n         Branch Group Profiles\n         Maps illustrating Congestion, Flows & Prices\n         Day Ahead & Hour Ahead Schedules for Load, Generation, Imports & \nExports - Coming Soon!\n\nCOMPUTING & NETWORK UPGRADES\nRecently our ISP implemented several upgrades to improve connectivity to all \nof our failover uplinks and provide increased\nreliability during an outage with any one upstream provider. Unfortunately \nduring this upgrade some of you were unable to\nget to our website the morning of February 27th. I apologize for this and \nwant to re-confirm that we try to never perform\nany upgrades or maintenance during business hours.  FriedWire is also very \npleased to announce that our entire system will\nbe upgraded in the next 30-days.  We have entered into a contract with Verado \n(formerly Firstworld) to migrate all of our\nsystems to their facility in Denver, Colorado.  With this migration we should \nsee increased performance and reliability in\nall of our systems.\n\nOLD DATA IN MAPS?

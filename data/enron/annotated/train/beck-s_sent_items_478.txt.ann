  "text": "The November newsletter looked great!  \n\nThis message was sent by Beverly Gibson for the December newsletter.  At Monday's board meeting, Lori Ewalt gave me an article about Senior Presentation for the December newsletter.  She doesn't have an electronic copy.  I will try this weekend to retype it as a word document and e-mail it to you.  Lori also said that she had given Janet Petrak a hard copy of a permission slip to be printed in the December newsletter.  (This is for parents to sign for under 17's to be out after midnight as they return from Senior Presentation).  Do you have that?  If not, you might contact Janet and ask her for that.  --Sally   \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \t\"Beverly Gibson\" <bgibson50606@houston.rr.com>@ENRON  \nSent:\tTuesday, November  6, 2001 10:55 PM\nTo:\tJanet Petrak; Beck, Sally\nSubject:\tNCL newsletter information\n\n\nFor next newsletter if space is  available:\n \nWhen you need to send an  e-mail sub request, please follow this procedure:\nE-mail me at bgibson50606@houston.rr.com  with  the pertinent information (date, time, place).

We will be\ne-mailing \nyou the address of the venue later this week.\n\nI have also included in the \nlist the first 8 people on the waitlist.

We should \nbe able to confirm by Thursday 2nd\nNovember whether or not this will be \npossible.\n\nAs you will note from the attachment, we have still not received \nbios from\nmany of you. The purpose of these bios is not only to help the VC's\n\nfamiliarise themselves with all of you in advance of the dinner, but to\nhelp \nus place you on tables with VC's in your particular area of interest.\nThe \nFINAL deadline to receive your bios will be TUESDAY 31st OCTOBER at\n7pm. \nPlease do try to e-mail me your bio by this time. If your bios are not\n\nreceived by then, we will have to place you randomly.\n\nAlso, many of you have \nsent me your regular resumes instead of the bios\nthat we asked for. These do \nnot serve the purpose of providing the VC's\nwith personalised and targeted \ninformation about you and why you are\ninterested in meeting with them at this \nevent. If you have sent me such a\nresume, we cannot guarantee that it will be \npresented in the same format to\nthe VC's.\n\nFollowing are the VC's who have \nconfirmed that they will be attending:\n\nMelissa Daniels, Morgan Stanley \nVenture Partners\nJennifer Gil Roberts, Sevin Rosen Funds\nJohn Oxaal, Sevin \nRosen Funds\nAlexander Gove, Walden VC\nKevin Hartz, iMinds Ventures\nRuss \nIrwin, Covergence Partners\nAndy Lazlo, VantagePoint\nMatt Ocklo, VantagePoint\n\nPeter Loukianoff, Technology Funding Venture Partners\nRoy Martinez, Intel \nCapital\nSusan Mason, Onset Ventures\nJoe McDonough, Barrington\nJay Morrison, \nNewbury Ventures\nAdele Oliva, Particof & Co.\nGeorge Phipps, Patricof & Co.\n\nNeil Weintraut, 21st Century Internet Venture Partners\n\n\n\n\nThis message \npowered by EMUMAIL. -- http://www.EMUMAIL.com\n\n - List_of_attendees_10.30.00.xls",

If you're refering to the PX \nstudy on whether to have an \"as-bid\" or \"single-price\" auction, the PX is in \nthe preliminary stages of having a report prepared.  What they've done is \nassemble a \"Blue Ribbon\" panel of economists (as reported in the press \naccounts you've seen) to examine the issue and report back.  I'm not aware of \na report having yet been completed by the panel and submitted to the PX.  \nHave you heard differently?  I'll poke around.\n\nBest,\nJeff",

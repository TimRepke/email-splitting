Gr=\negg receives high marks from Enron legal, credit, risk management, and fina=\nnce as a tremendous resource and from Peoples Sr. Management.  I believe En=\nron many times overlooks the importance of account management and Gregg is =\na classic example of an employee who balances the needs of the customer wit=\nh keeping Enron's interests foremost.

Richard serves as the inf=\normation conduit to the Central desk and Enron Houston.  Richard is excelle=\nnt at balancing his role to Enron and the complete trust that Peoples has p=\nlaced in him.  Richard is a rare find and perfect fit in a joint venture be=\ncause of his tenure at Enron involving stints in economics, risk management=\n, structuring and trading.  Richard is the key reason we have kept a balanc=\ne of trust with the utilities of Peoples.  Richard has been engaged with th=\nis customer for 3 years and the trust/knowledge Peoples bestows to Richard =\nis directly related to this history, Richard's hard work and inherent custo=\nmer skills.    A departure by Richard would provide a very difficult issue =\nfor Hunter and I due to the balanced approach Richard exemplifies.  Richard=\n is Hunter's on sight control of the enovate business.\n\nIf you would like to discuss this further, please contact me at 713/853-385=\n5.  I recommend we proceed immediately and prior to my full-time departure =\nfrom Chicago scheduled for August.",

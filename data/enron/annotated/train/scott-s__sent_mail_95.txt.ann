My previous drafts have provided for \nposting of Shipper call options only.  All other types of options will be \ngenerally available, on a nondiscriminatory basis, through our tariff.  My \nthinking was that it is commercially impracticable to post the specifics of \nall types of options, and it's not necessary since options will be noted on \nour transaction reports required by Order 637.  Let me know what you think.\n\nLet me know your comments as soon as possible.  I understand that the \nCommercial Group told Stan Horton this would be filed this week and Shelley \nreported at staff meeting on Monday that it would be filed this week or next \nweek.  As soon as I get everyone's comments we can get this finalized.\n\nThank you.\n",

The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that w=\ne have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues.=20\n?=09During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exc=\nhange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug,=\n which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the be=\ntter part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which ap=\npears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchan=\nge servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug.\n?=09Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experience=\nd database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Ou=\ntlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchan=\nge servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected serv=\ner.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use --=\n we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems wit=\nh the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the bus=\niness week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on W=\nednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to mov=\ne users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impac=\nted users could not access their e-mail.\n?=09During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and danger=\nous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against virus=\nes that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail =\nis scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktop=\ns.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning=\n updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day. =\n The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance=\n of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus =\nproduct rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but w=\ne believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron co=\nmputing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this t=\nime, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that =\nwill speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as th=\ne performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to =\nget better.\nThere is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the las=\nt few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the=\n overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and=\n meet Enron's business needs and expectations.\n\nEnron Global Technology",

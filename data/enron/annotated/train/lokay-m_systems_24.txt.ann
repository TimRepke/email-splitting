The \nsystem we normally use to create it on was down and even though this one was \ncompatible with the group I test with, it did not work well with everyone.  \nIf you have trouble viewing or printing the format, or just prefer another \nformat, I have 2 other versions I can send you.  Just reply to this note or \ncall me at 713-853-3986.  If the majority have problems and another version \nworks, I'll resend it to the whole group.  For the moment, I'll keep working \none-on-one.  \n\nThanks,\nDonna",

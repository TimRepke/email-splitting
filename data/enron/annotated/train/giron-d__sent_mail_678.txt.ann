I just need to \nfollow-up with Mary Lynn on Friday before I submit requests.  I'm also \nworking on OA issues for July.  I will teach a class on Thursday and next \nTuesday to settlements about OA (just basics like desk price, customer price, \nand liquidations).  In addition, I need to ask you a few questions about the \nTrunkline deal.  When I meet with Mary Lynn on Friday, I am going to explain \nthe deal to her.  That's about it.  Once again, I apologize about missing the \nmeeting today.\n\nDG    3-9573",

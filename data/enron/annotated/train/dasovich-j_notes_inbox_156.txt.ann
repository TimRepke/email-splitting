  "text": "Jeff,\nAs I mentioned in my voice mail message, we met today with a group of \ncustomers in a workshop format to discuss the options filing, proposed \namendment and tariff changes.  With the possible exception of one company \n(Amoco), I thought the comments/feedback were mostly positive.  \n\nThere seems to be two principal areas of concern with the proposed program:  \n(1) the possibility of affiliate abuse by ENA or EES, and (2) the potential \nof a party (ENA, or 3rd party) to exert market power.  Our position going \ninto the workshop, and our most likely response going into the FERC \nproceeding, is that Transwestern doesn't want to be put into the position of \nbeing a \"gatekeeper\" for these issues, particularly with respect to market \npower.  In addition, we believe there are adequate protections under existing \nFERC policies (Order no. 497) regarding affiliate transactions.  \n\nWe have a couple more personal meetings with the utilities in California \n(SoCal and PG&E) to complete prior to moving forward with the filing.  I'm \nplanning on going out to California the week of Sept. 11.  I'd love to hook \nup with you while I'm there.  I'll call you with specifics shortly.  \n\nIf can answer any questions for you regarding the documents or the program \nitself, please give me a call at ext. 3-1521.\n\n",

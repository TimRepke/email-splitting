  "text": "As promised, here is a Cliff's Notes version of the law of quantum meruit in \nthe State of Texas.\n\nThe doctrine of quantum meruit is based on the principle of equity that a \nparty deserves to be paid for the services or materials he furnishes to one \nwho knowingly accepts them. See Davidson v. Clearman, 391 S .W.2d 48 \n(Tex.1965). This remedy is based on the promise implied by law to pay for \nbeneficial services rendered and accepted. Id.; see Campbell v. Northwestern \nNat'l Life Ins. Co., 573 S.W.2d 496, 498 (Tex.1978). The Texas Supreme Court \nin Bashara v. Baptist Mem'l Hosp. Sys., 685 S.W.2d 307 (Tex.1985), set out \nfour elements for recovery under quantum meruit: (1) valuable services \nrendered or materials furnished; (2) for the person sought to be charged; (3) \nwhich were accepted by the person sought to be charged and were used and \nenjoyed by him; (4) under such circumstances that he would reasonably know \nthat the plaintiff expected to be paid for the services. Bashara v. Baptist \nMem'l Hosp. Sys., 685 S.W.2d at 310 (quoting City of Ingleside v. Stewart, \n554 S.W.2d 939, 943 (Tex.Civ.App.--Corpus Christi 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.)).\n\nThere are several cases -- all outside the State of Texas -- in which \nrecruiting agencies seek recovery under the doctrine of quantum meruit from \ncompanies with whom they have placed an individual.  Cutting to the chase, \nthe fundamental inquiry in such a case -- have the elements of quantum meruit \nbeen satisfied? -- ends up being a factual issue for a jury to decide, not a \nlegal question for a judge.\n\nLet me know if I can be of further assistance.",

  "text": "Phase 2 testimony is due May 26, 2000 and addresses rate design issues \n\nRate design and ratemaking proposals submitted in testimony should follow the \nprinciples: \n1. provide for fair cost allocation among customers;\n\n2. allow the utility distribution companies (UDCs) adequate cost recovery \nwhile minimizing costs to consumers; \n\n3. facilitate customer-side distributed generation deployment; and send \nproper price signals to prospective purchasers of distributed generation. \n\nTestimony should identify how current rate structures and those proposed in \nother Commission proceedings may prevent or hinder deployment of distributed \ngeneration, and how rate structures could be modified to facilitate \ndistributed generation deployment.  Parties should discuss the \ninterrelationship among rate design issues:  stranded costs, bypass, demand, \ncustomer and grid charges, standby rates, and PBR and flexible pricing \nmechanisms.\nAdditionally, rate design issues related to interconnection costs should be \naddressed.  Issues include cost recovery and allocation, such as who should \npay for costs to interconnect to the distribution system and for \ninterconnection studies, or if costs incurred by the first distributed \ngeneration customers on a specific circuit or feeder should be shared by \nsubsequent distributed generation customers connecting to the same facilities.\n\nThe attachment (Attachment A) provides 36 questions and a framework for the \nissues the Commission will consider in Phase 2 of this proceeding.  \n\nSee attached ruling for details.\n",

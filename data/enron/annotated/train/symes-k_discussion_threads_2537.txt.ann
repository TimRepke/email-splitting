  "text": "Hi Kate!\nI am beginning to see a familiar pattern beginning in the West (-familiar \nbecause it's the same problem we have with East traders).  There are A LOT of \ndeals that need to be changed to \"no confirm.\"  I'd like to fax a list of \nthem to you so that you can 1st, change their status in Deal Entry to \"not to \nbe confirmed\" and 2nd, bug the traders who enter the deals to remember to \nenter them correctly.  Also, you mentioned working with Will Smith in IT to \nget these deals to automatically be \"no confirm\" when the traders enter \nthem.  You may want to use some of these as examples so to help IT figure the \nlogic behind which deals are confirmed and which aren't.  Please let me know \nyour fax number so that i can send you this report.  \nThanks!\nKim x31647",

  "text": "Kim - \nI've finished changing the list of deals you faxed over to no confirm. Please \nlet me know if you continue to see these deals on your new deal report. I \nstill had questions on some of the Short Term and Long Term Northwest deals. \nOn those I will defer to Diana Scholtes. I also have questions on the \nfollowing deals:\n\n557772 - why are we not confirming a daily with Pacificorp?\n552516 - why are we not confirming a daily with Riverside?\n\nAnd there were two deals I couldn't for the life of me read on that fax, so \nyou may still see deals showing up that don't necessarily need to be \nconfirmed.\n\n\nDiana - \nI know we had decided not to confirm deals done with Portland General \nElectric, but before I change the following deals to \"no confirm\" I want to \nclarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty.\n 1. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is elsewhere (Mid-C, \nMontana System, etc.), do we confirm?\n 2. If the counterparty is something other than PGE and the delivery point is \nPortland General System, do we confirm?\n 3. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is Portland General \nSystem, do we confirm? \nI apologize for asking so many questions, but I've got a long list of deals \nin front of me and before I create an irreparable mess I wanted to check that \nI'm doing this right. Please let me know.\n\n553666 \n553667\n553668\n555174\n555175\n555177\n555178\n556365\n556366\n556367\n556368\n557665\n557666\n557667\n557668\n557734\n558952\n558957\n558958\n558959\n558960\n\nThank you both for all your help.\n\nKate",

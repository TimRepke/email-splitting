Several individuals may not show up on your bonus list since employees who previously received retention bonuses have been omitted, but these individuals will show up on your merit list.  Please work through these lists and forward your suggestions to Fran Fagan by December 28.  As guidelines:\n\n       1. We MUST, in the aggregate, come in below the sum of the proposed bonus levels.\n       2.  Individual bonuses which exceed last year's amounts will be strictly scrutinized at three levels (me, Stan, and the Comp. Committee), so the story had better be good.\n       3.  I'd like to see extraordinary performance during the past few months, particularly in a leadership capacity, heavily weighted in your consideration.",

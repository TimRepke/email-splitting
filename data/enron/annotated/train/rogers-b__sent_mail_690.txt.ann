Due to this disability, the GMAT score is not a \ngood indicator of how I will do at UT.  Through what I have learned in my \nwork experiences with State Street Bank and Enron, I know that I will be able \nto successfully do the work that UT requires.  If you could let me know what \nI can do to further explain my GMAT score I would greatly appreciate it.  If \nyou think it would be better to talk to Dr. Harris-I will do that.  Thanks \nagain for taking the time to help me with this issue.  \nBen",

National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract \nto our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. \n\nFSS\n We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  \nHowever, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth \non any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like \nTrco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  \n\nIAS\nWe give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel \nis still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any \npoint we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we \nwithdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.\n\nCOST\nWhat we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy \nand payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel \n1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, \nand August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge \non my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in \nSitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track \nof the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is \ncapured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback \nand withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on \nthis deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any \nwithdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to \nkeep the tickets balanced.\n\nPayback Techniques\nUnder the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, \nDick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.\n\nNiagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to \ncapacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with \nthe gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can \nship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at \ntoday's prices that cost about $.105\n\nWadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and \npayback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, \nassuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.\n\nTenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the \nGulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on \nsegmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot \nuse the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.\n\nLet me know if you have any questons.\n\n\n\n",

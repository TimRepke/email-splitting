The commercial terms have been tentatively agreed to, pending GTB management approval.  The other terms and conditions are generally agreed to, and the actual wording is in draft form; the expectation is to execute the letter agreement by 31 December 2001.  Also, GTB expects to execute their agreement with the replacement contractor by 11 January 2002, with the assignment from EPCSC to be effective then.\n\nGTB agreed to pay their past due invoices by 26 December 2001.  A payment schedule, with conditions and target dates, was agreed to for the balance of payments.  All are targeted to be paid during January 2002.\n\nEnron Pipeline Construction Services Company (EPCSC) received no payments since last week's report.

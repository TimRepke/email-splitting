I also want to receive written confirmation from Accounting, Tax, ENA \nLegal, EGF Legal that they have signed off on the documents.   The only \ndocument left outstanding which the legal team is busily working on for \ncompletion [today hopefully?] is the EPC Contract.\n\nStarting on Monday, the legal team needs to begin the closing due diligence \nprocess.  Given that we thought we had a great call with GE this week and got \nat least S&S's signoff on consent letter, we haven't heard from anyone.  This \nis UNACCEPTABLE since it puts not just TurboPark but all the deals relying on \nTurboPark in jeopardy!\n\nI will arrange a meeting on Monday to walk through the closing checklist with \nthe legal team to insure that everything can be completed by December 13th.\n\nCLOSING WILL OCCUR ON DECEMBER 15TH!\n\nHappy Holidays,\nLisa",

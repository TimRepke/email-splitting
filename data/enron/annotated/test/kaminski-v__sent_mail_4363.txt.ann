There might have been a glitch in the \nCC-mail\nand the message did not go through and wasn't  stored.\n\nI wanted to make the following points:\n\n1. Brad will not show up on March 15. He is still working on his dot-com \nbusiness and wants to\npursue this opportunity.\n\n2. My recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand. Either Brad \nor a stipend\nrefund check should show up on March 15.\n\n3. I told Brad that  a failure to show up on March 15 will not imperil his \nfuture employment opportunities\nwith Enron. We just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource \nneeds. If he decides to re-apply\nat some point in the future, we shall not hold his  decision  to pursue him \nentrepreneurial plans against him.\n\nPlease, let me  know what you think.\n\nVince",

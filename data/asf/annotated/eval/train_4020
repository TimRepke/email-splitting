Hi,
I want to aggregate hits by Country, State, City. I would these as tags in
my sample data.

How would I do aggregation at different levels ? Input data would be single
record

Should I do flatMap transformation first and create 3 records from 1 input
record, or is there a better way to do it ?

thank you,
basanth

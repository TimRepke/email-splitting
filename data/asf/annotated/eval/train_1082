Hi Patrick,

I think (but I'm not 100% sure) its not a difference in what the engine
does in the end, its more of an API thing. When you are grouping, you can
perform operations such as reducing afterwards.
On a partitioned dataset, you can do stuff like processing each partition
in parallel, or sort them.

The parallelism is independent of the partitioning or grouping. Usually
there are more partitions than parallel instances, so each instance will
take care of multiple partitions.

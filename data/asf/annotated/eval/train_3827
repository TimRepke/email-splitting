Hi all! I added a S3 bucketing sink operator to my flink job and tried to
start it from a savepoint using --allowNonRestoreState option, and it's
showing me this error:
<http://apache-flink-user-mailing-list-archive.2336050.n4.nabble.com/file/n14674/flink_exception.png>


I found on Flink official document saying:
<http://apache-flink-user-mailing-list-archive.2336050.n4.nabble.com/file/n14674/flink_state.png>

So I suppose the restoration should succeed even if the operator number
doesn't match. Can someone explain to me why this happens, and what's the
possible solution?

FYI, some specs:
Flink version: 1.2.1
Job parallelism: 10
S3 sink parallelism: 1
Job execution graph:

Thanks

Hi Paul,

since each operator uses the minimum watermark of all its inputs, you must
ensure that each parallel task is producing data.
If a source does not produce data, it will not increase the timestamps of
its watermarks.

Another challenge, that you might run into is that you need to make sure
that the file (or file chunks if it is split for parallel reading) is read
in the increasing timestamp order.
Otherwise, watermarks will be emitted too early. I

If I got understood your use case correctly, you are just experimenting
with file input to get a feeling for the API.
I would try to set the parallelism of the file source to 1 to ensure that
the data is read in the same order and that all tasks are producing data.

Hope this helps,
Fabian

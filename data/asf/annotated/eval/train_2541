Hi Sathi,

configuring managed memory and taskmanager heap memory also depends on 
your jobs. If your jobs involve much sorting, then a high managed memory 
is helpful. If you are creating a lot of objects in your functions, that 
need some time until they get garbage collected (ideally you should not 
use `new` at all), then a larger Java heap might be useful instead of 
managed memory.

Regards,
Timo

Yes, I think so. @Aljoscha, please correct me if I describe something wrong
here.

The first map tasks (Map(1) and Map(2)) broadcast their watermarks to all
connected subsequent tasks (window(1) and window(2)).
The window tasks update their respective watermarks based on the watermarks
received from their input tasks (map(1) and map(2)) and forward their
watermarks to all connected subsequent tasks.
Since map does not require a shuffle, mapB(1) will receive only watermarks
from window(1) and mapB(2) from window(2). However, since the watermarks of
the windows depend on their inputs (map(1) and map(2)), the mapB tasks will
get watermarks from all inputs.

Note that watermarks are not bound to specified records but define the
"logical time" of an operator.
Because watermarks are always broadcasted to all subsequent tasks, the
whole application is "synced" to the same time after the first keyBy() (or
anyother kind of full shuffle).
So the progress of time is determined by the "slowest" input.

Best, Fabian

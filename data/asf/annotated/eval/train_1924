It happens if I use keyBy().  But there is no need for it to happen, which
is why I was asking about rekeying without repartitioning.  The stream is
already partitioned by A, so all elements of a new stream keyed by (A,B)
are already being processed by the local task.  Reshuffling as a result of
rekeying would have no benefit and would double the network traffic.  It is
why I suggested subKey(B) may be a good to clearly indicate that the new
key just sub-partitions the existing key partition without requiring
reshuffling.

Why would you not be able to use a different key type with
keyByWithoutRepartitioning()?

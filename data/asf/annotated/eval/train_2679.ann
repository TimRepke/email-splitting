What you\nnormally would do is write the data out to some file system (for example HDFS) and use env.execute()\nfor actually running the program. Simply specifying a program like this:\n\nExecutionEnv env = \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nDataSet<> input = env.read(\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6)\nDataSet<> transformed = input.map(new MyMapFunction())\ntransformed.write(FileOutputFormat)\n\nDoes not actually execute anything, this just builds up an execution graph. Calling env.execute()\nis what actually ships the graph to a cluster and executes it in parallel.\n\nBest,\nAljoscha\n> On 5.

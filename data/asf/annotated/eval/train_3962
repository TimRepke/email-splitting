Hi

We have use case where we have thousands of Telegraf agents sending data to
kafka( some of them are sending 10s interval, 15s interval and 30s
interval). We would like to aggregate the incoming data to 1 minuter
interval based on the hostname as key before we write into influxdb. Is it
possible to do this type of usecase with Flink? if so any sample to get
started?

sample data ( influxdb line protocal) coming from Kafka

Hi,

How are you specifying the port? Because in YARN mode the config setting is different: yarn.application-master.port.
Also, you cannot specify the IP of the JobManager in YARN mode because Flink does not have
any influence in how YARN schedules the JobManager so it could run on any machine in the YARN
cluster.

By the way, what's the motivation for knowing the JobManager coordinates within a Job?

Best,
Aljoscha

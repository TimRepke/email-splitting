Hello,

In our Sink, we are dealing with a system that uses OAuth 2.0. So the in the open() method
of the Sink we are getting the token and then we initialise the client that we can use in
order to write from Flink to that API.

Is there a better approach to handle that? 

open() is a lifecycle method which I assume it will be called only once when creating a Sink,
correct? Are there any conditions that might trigger open() to be called not upon creations?

Thanks a lot for your help and time.

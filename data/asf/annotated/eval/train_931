Hi Robert,

sorry for the long delay.

I didn't get any exception, it just seems to read nothing (or at least
don't match any opening/closing tags).

I digged a bit into the code and found out, that Mahout's XmlInputFormat
[0] extends the TextInputFormat [1].  TextInputFormat then uses the
LineRecordReader [2] which handles the compressed data.

However, the Mahout XMLRecordReader [3] does not contain the compression
handling. So I tried to build a XmlRecordReader which tries to achieve
that [4]. I use it to split the wikipedia dumps into pages with <page>
and </page> tags. [5]

It does work, but somehow misses some data sometimes and I guess this is
because of the different splits. How do FileSplits work? Can a process
read beyond the FileSplit boundary or not?

I'm also a bit confused why the Flink Doc says that Bzip2 is not
splittable? [6]
Afaik hadoop (and flink in compatibility mode) does support splittable,
compressed data.

I would appreciate some input/ideas/help with this.

All the best,
Sebastian

Hi,

we start our Flink Jobs on EMR with Lambda functions. Lambda functions
can have various triggers, among many others they can be triggered by
some CloudWatch rule. So you could create a rule based on your desires
that triggers a Lambda function, which will in turn spin up an EMR
cluster with the steps being your particular jobs.

Hope that helps,
best regards

Konstantin

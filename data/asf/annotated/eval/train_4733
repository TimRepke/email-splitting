Hi,

As Biplob said this means that the JM cannot find the requested state.

The reasons can be one of the above but given that you said you are using
the FlinkMiniCluster, I assume you are testing. In this case, it can also
be that you start querying your state to soon after the job is submitted,
so the state is not yet there as the job that creates it has not yet
started.

In this case you can retry the query when it fails until it succeeds
 (assuming that none of the coditions that Biplob mentioned holds). If you
have access to the flink code, you can check the tests in the
queryablestate IT cases.

I hope this is the right place to ask about custom search components.

I'm writing a custom search component. My aim is iterate over the entire
result set and do some aggregate computation. In order to implement my
algorithm I require to iterate over the result set in the order declared in
the search query. 

I've taken statsComponent as a relevant example. It iterates over the
results using rb.getResults().docSet and searcher.getIndexReader().leaves()
but it seems that these methods does not respect the query sort order. 

I've tried creating a new TopCollector and requesting it to collect all the
data. It works but takes too long. 

Is there a way to iterate over the sorted result set in an efficient way?
I'm working on solr 4.11, but upgrading to a newer version is acceptable if
necessary.

Thanks!

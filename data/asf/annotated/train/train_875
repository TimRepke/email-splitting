Would omitTermFreqAndPositions help here? Though that's probably an
overkill as that disables phrase searches too. I am not sure if it is
possible to do omitTermFreqAndPositions=true omitPositions=false to
just skip frequencies.

the query analysis chain that contains ICUTokenizerFactory, WordDelimiterFilterFactory and
whatnot.

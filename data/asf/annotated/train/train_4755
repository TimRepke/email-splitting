HI Team,
As per my requirement I need to pass password dynamically to data source .
I did it successfully through Http URL by auto indexing time. Like below.

In Application data import property file declare URL and password like this 

params=/dataimport?command=delta-import&clean=false&commit=true&pwd=Beta*****

In SOLR Core(web logic) db-data-config.xml file fetching password on auto
indexing like bellow.

<dataSource driver="oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver"
url="jdbc:oracle:thin:@URL:Port/Schema" user="myUser***"
password="${dataimporter.request.pwd}"/>


But In this case if password changed need to deploy application Again with
new password,


So, I declare password variable in solrconfig.xml , dataimport.properties
and core.properties files and try to fetch in to db-data-config.xml file,
But its not working. Can you please help me out to use password in
configuration file like able to update with put deployment.

Thank you
Javeed Ali Khan

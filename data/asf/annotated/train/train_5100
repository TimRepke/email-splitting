It doesn't seem to matter what you do in the query analyzer, if you have a
wildcard, it won't use it. Which is exactly the behavior I observed.

the solution was to set preserveOriginal="1" and change the etl process to
not strip the dashes, letting the index analyzer do that. We have a lot of
legacy etl which was developed to load Endeca. It's not always what we want
with Solr

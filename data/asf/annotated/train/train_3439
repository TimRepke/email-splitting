hey all. i'm sending data out that could represent a purchased item or a
competitive alternative. when the results are returned i'm needing to know
which of the two were hit so i can serve up the *other*.

i can make a blunt instrument in the application layer to simply look for a
match between the queried terms and the resulting fields, but the problem
of fuzzy matching and some of the special analysis being done to get the
hits will be for naught.

cursory googling landed me at a similar discussion that suggested using hit
highlighting or retrieving the debuggers explain data to sort through.

is there another, more efficient means or are these the two tools in the
toolbox?

thanks!

I would probably start by renting a VM at a third location to run Zookeeper.

> A customer has two locations (a few km apart) with super-fast networking in-between,
so for day-to-day operation they view all VMs in both locations as a pool of servers. They
typically spin up redundant servers for various services in each zone and if a zone should
fail (they are a few km apart), the other will just continue working.

active-passive only so it anyway requires manual intervention to catch up if indexing is switched
to the passive DC temporarily.

cross zones and all would be fine.

by a restart of the surviving Solr nodes in order to point to the “new” ZK.

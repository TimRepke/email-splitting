I did use this class using batch file (from Windows server), but it still does not remove anything.
I sent number of snapshots to keep as 3, but I have more in my folder.

You can try run purge manually see if it is working: org.apache.zookeeper.server.PurgeTxnLog.

And use a cron job to do clean up.

    Hello

    I'm using Zookeeper 3.4.6

    The ZK log data folder keeps growing with transaction logs files (log.*).

    I set the following in zoo.cfg:
    autopurge.purgeInterval=1
    autopurge.snapRetainCount=3
    dataDir=..\\data

    Per ZK log, it reads those parameters:

    2017-07-09 17:44:59,792 [myid:] - INFO  [main:DatadirCleanupManager@78] - autopurge.snapRetainCount
set to 3
    2017-07-09 17:44:59,792 [myid:] - INFO  [main:DatadirCleanupManager@79] - autopurge.purgeInterval
set to 1

    It also says that cleanup process is running:

    2017-07-09 17:44:59,792 [myid:] - INFO  [PurgeTask:DatadirCleanupManager$PurgeTask@138]
- Purge task started.
    2017-07-09 17:44:59,823 [myid:] - INFO  [PurgeTask:DatadirCleanupManager$PurgeTask@144]
- Purge task completed.

    But actually nothing is deleted.
    Every service restart, new file is created.

    The only parameter I managed to change is preAllocSize, which means the minimum size per
file. The default is 64MB. I changed it to 10KB only for watching the effect.

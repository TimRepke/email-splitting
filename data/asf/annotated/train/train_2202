Thought of an alternate interpretation of what you asked about -- info
on the *query* side, not the *index* side.  This addresses that
alternate interpretation:

If you add "&debugQuery=true" to the URL, you'll see a lot of debug
information.  One piece of useful information there is the original
query, and the *parsed* query.  By comparing those, you would be able to
detect the synonyms applied at query time.

There may also be a "debug=XXXX" option that would only generate the
parsed query without spending the resources to generate the rest of the
debug info, but I am not familiar with all the debug options.  I know
that debugQuery=true will include that information, but the full debug
might cause your queries to become unacceptably slow.  There is a LOT of
info generated by the generic debugQuery.

Thanks,
Shawn

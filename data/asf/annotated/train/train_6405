Its really hard to filter through the issues in Jira,  710 open
major/critical issues since 2010, using this query:

project = SOLR AND issuetype = Bug And priority in (Blocker,Critical,
Major) AND status in (Open, "In Progress", Reopened) ORDER BY createdDate
ASC

Are there any performance tests done on solr for each release?

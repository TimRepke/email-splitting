  "text": "Thanks everyone. I was indeed changing the type for a couple of fields in my schema, for reasons\nI no longer recall; a tutorial said it would resolve some kind of error, but maybe that's\noutdated. I can now get the results I wanted with a pretty simple boost, so I think I'm good\nfor now.\n\nChip\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Erick Erickson [mailto:erickerickson@gmail.com] \nSent: Tuesday, May 16, 2017 10:45 AM\nTo: solr-user <solr-user@lucene.apache.org>\nSubject: Re: Terms not being indexed; not sure why\n\nWhat David said. There are a very few cases where changing your schema does _not_ require\nthat you blow away your index and re-index from scratch. I always blow the index away when\nI make any changes if at all possible.\n\nAlso note that when you quote, you are asking for _phrases_, so searching for title:\"University\nof Wisconsin\" requires that these words appear next to each other. If you just want all the\nwords to be in a field, try title:(University of Wisconsin)\n\nBut as David says, something's very weird. Note that when you search against the _text_ field\nyou get a parsed query like:\n\n\"parsedquery_toString\": \"_text_:university _text_:of _text_:wisconsin\",\n\nwhereas against title \"University\" is not lowercased.\n\nBy the way, the admin UI>>select core or collection>>analysis page is invaluable\nhere. It shows you exactly what transformations happen at index and query time.\n\nAnd the \"schema browser\" link allows you to see the actual terms in your index.\n\nThen there's the TermsComponent here:\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+Terms+Component\nwhich allows you to see what's actually in your index (i.e. the analyzed values).\n\nTogether these tools make Solr a little less of a \"black box\". And if you really want to examine\nthe index, get a copy of Luke, although I'm not sure how up to date it is.\n\nGood Luck!\nErick\n\nOn Tue, May 16, 2017 at 7:30 AM, David Hastings <hastings.recursive@gmail.com> wrote:\n> something in text_general isnt actually doing what its supposed to be \n> doing, is it possible you indexed it as a string then changed the type \n> for the field after the fact?\n>\n> on my title i have something like such:\n>\n> \"rawquerystring\": \"title:University\",\n>    \"querystring\": \"title:University\",\n>    \"parsedquery\": \"title:university\",\n>    \"parsedquery_toString\": \"title:university\",\n>\n>\n> maybe try re-indexing the document and see if that does it.  even your \n> LowerCaseFilterFactoryisnt converting it to university.\n>\n>\n> On Tue, May 16, 2017 at 10:10 AM, Chip Calhoun <ccalhoun@aip.org> wrote:\n>\n>> Now that I know what to look for in the debugQuery it's becoming more \n>> clear.

      "text": "\nWhat David said. There are a very few cases where changing your schema does _not_ require\nthat you blow away your index and re-index from scratch. I always blow the index away when\nI make any changes if at all possible.\n\nAlso note that when you quote, you are asking for _phrases_, so searching for title:\"University\nof Wisconsin\" requires that these words appear next to each other. If you just want all the\nwords to be in a field, try title:(University of Wisconsin)\n\nBut as David says, something's very weird. Note that when you search against the _text_ field\nyou get a parsed query like:\n\n\"parsedquery_toString\": \"_text_:university _text_:of _text_:wisconsin\",\n\nwhereas against title \"University\" is not lowercased.\n\nBy the way, the admin UI>>select core or collection>>analysis page is invaluable\nhere. It shows you exactly what transformations happen at index and query time.\n\nAnd the \"schema browser\" link allows you to see the actual terms in your index.\n\nThen there's the TermsComponent here:\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+Terms+Component\nwhich allows you to see what's actually in your index (i.e. the analyzed values).\n\nTogether these tools make Solr a little less of a \"black box\". And if you really want to examine\nthe index, get a copy of Luke, although I'm not sure how up to date it is.\n\nGood Luck!\nErick\n\n",

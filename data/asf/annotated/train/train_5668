Odd. The way core discovery works, it starts at SOLR_HOME and
recursively descends the directories. Whenever the recursion finds a
"core.properties" file it says "Aha, this must be a core". From there
it assumes the data directory is immediately below where it found the
core.properties file in the absence of any dataDir overrides.

So how the write.lock file is getting preserved across Solr restarts
is a mystery to me. Doing a "kill -9" is one way to make that happen
if it is done at just the wrong time, but that's unlikely in what
you're describing.

Are you totally sure that there were no old Solr processes running?
And there have been some issues in the past where the log display of
the admin UI hold on to errors and displays them after the problem has
been fixed. I'm assuming you can't query the new core, is that
correct? Because if you can query the core then _something_ has the
index open. I'm grasping at straws here mind you.

Best,
Erick

No other cores are present.

Well, I know they can change.

I think, the main problem here it that (in this point) documents completely
unrelated to a topic are being ranked as high as documents related. So, in
order to penalize them we are trying to use the ratio or term frequency/word
length.

Nevertheless we aren't able to find a practical way to make it.

Greetings.

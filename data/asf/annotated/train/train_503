Alexandre:

We recommend only using alphanum and underscore here:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Defining+Fields. WDYT
about adding an explicit warning about this problem there? Or a JIRA
about "field names with periods cannot use field qualifiers like
f.<fieldname>.facet.limit where <fieldname> contains periods"?

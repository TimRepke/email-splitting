Ronald:

Actually, people generally don't search on master ;). The idea is that
master is configured for heavy indexing and then people search on the
slaves which are configured for heavy query loads (e.g. memory,
autowarming, whatever may be different). Which is it's own problem
since the time the slaves poll won't necessarily be the exact same
wall-clock time.....

SolrCloud doesn't use replication except in certain recovery
scenarios. In normal operations, documents are forwarded to each
replica and indexed separately on all nodes. That's about the only way
to support Near Real Time.

Best,
Erick

I could see that master(searching) and master(replicable) both changed.  And autocommit.maxtime

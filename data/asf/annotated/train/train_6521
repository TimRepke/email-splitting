Hi,

I have some custom code in solr (which is not of good quality for
contributing back) so I need to setup my own continuous build solution. I
tried jenkins and was hoping that ant build (ant clean compile) in Execute
Shell textbox will work, but I am stuck at this ivy-fail error:

To work around it, I also added another step in the 'Execute Shell' (ant
ivy-bootstrap), which succeeds but 'ant clean compile' still fails with the
following error. I guess that I am not alone in doing this so there should
be some standard work around for this.

ivy-fail:
     [echo]
     [echo]      This build requires Ivy and Ivy could not be found in
your ant classpath.
     [echo]
     [echo]      (Due to classpath issues and the recursive nature of
the Lucene/Solr
     [echo]      build system, a local copy of Ivy can not be used an
loaded dynamically
     [echo]      by the build.xml)
     [echo]
     [echo]      You can either manually install a copy of Ivy 2.3.0
in your ant classpath:
     [echo]        http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html#optionalTasks
     [echo]
     [echo]      Or this build file can do it for you by running the
Ivy Bootstrap target:
     [echo]        ant ivy-bootstrap
     [echo]
     [echo]      Either way you will only have to install Ivy one time.
     [echo]
     [echo]      'ant ivy-bootstrap' will install a copy of Ivy into
your Ant User Library:
     [echo]        /home/jenkins/.ant/lib
     [echo]
     [echo]      If you would prefer, you can have it installed into
an alternative
     [echo]      directory using the
"-Divy_install_path=/some/path/you/choose" option,
     [echo]      but you will have to specify this path every time you
build Lucene/Solr
     [echo]      in the future...
     [echo]        ant ivy-bootstrap -Divy_install_path=/some/path/you/choose
     [echo]        ...
     [echo]        ant -lib /some/path/you/choose clean compile
     [echo]        ...
     [echo]        ant -lib /some/path/you/choose clean compile
     [echo]
     [echo]      If you have already run ivy-bootstrap, and still get
this message, please
     [echo]      try using the "--noconfig" option when running ant,
or editing your global
     [echo]      ant config to allow the user lib to be loaded.  See
the wiki for more details:

Yes, it has been asked many times and has been answered both on the
list and in the - awesome - Reference Guide. I'd recommend reading
that and then coming back again with more specific question:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Overview+of+Documents%2C+Fields%2C+and+Schema+Design

One confusion to clarify though. API is HTTP API, Admin UI just uses
it and does not - yet - expose everything possible. You can always
just hit Solr directly for the missing bits. Again, RTARG (.. Awesome
Reference Guide) and then come back with specifics:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Schema+API

   Alex.

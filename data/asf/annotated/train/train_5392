Hi,
I'm trying to use the ManagedSynonyms with *ignoreCase=true*
It is working fine for the identifying part but the problem comes in
synonym value
Suppose i have a synonym *iwatch ==>appleWatch,iWatch*
If the user query is *iwatch (in any case)*  it was identifying the synonym
and replace the token with *applewatch and iwatch*  (in lowercase),which i
didn't want
I need the synonyms to comes with the same case what i have configured
i.e. *appleWatch and iWatch*
Any idea on how to so that .

Thanks,
Aman Deep Singh

The answer to your question is going to be less about the query
structure and more about the type of field you're using and any defined
analysis for that type.

With a schema field type that is properly configured, the query you are
trying to use (with quotes) should work, as long as it is being directed
specifically to the correct field as Erick mentioned.  Note that if you
change your schema to make this work, you will need to entirely reindex.

Nearly any of the "text" field types included in the example schemas
will do the job.  The "string" or "strings" types in the examples will
NOT work, because they do not break the text into multiple tokens
(search terms).  I think you're probably trying to search a field that
is using one of the latter types.

Can you share your schema and the name of the field that you are
querying?  Your followup message tells us the version of Solr (6.5.1),
so the most likely filename for the schema will be "managed-schema" with
no extension.  If there have been significant changes from an example in
your solrconfig.xml file, it would be a good idea to share that too.

Thanks,
Shawn

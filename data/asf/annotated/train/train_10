Hi,

I have a SolrCloud setup with 5 nodes and am creating collections with a 
replication factor of 3. If I kill and restart nodes at the "right" time 
during the creation process the creation seems to get stuck. Collection 
data is left in the clusterstate.json file in ZooKeeper and no 
collections can be created anymore until this entry gets removed. I can 
reproduce this on Solr 6.2.1 and 6.3, while 6.3 seems to be somewhat 
less likely to get stuck. Is Solr supposed to recover from data being 
stuck in the clusterstate.json at some point? I had one instance where 
it looked like data was removed again but normally the data does not 
seem to get cleaned up automatically and just blocks any further 
collection creations.

I did not find anything like this in Jira. Just SOLR-7198 sounds a bit 
similar even though it is about deleting collections.

regards,
Hendrik

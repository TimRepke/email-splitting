Hi All,

We are using managed synonyms functionality at index time but one-way & replacement are
not working as desired. Below are some examples that are not working
Can anyone help to understand how the index time synonyms works in Solr . We are using edismax
with mm=2>-1 5>100%, ps=5

Below entries highlighted in yellow are not working. We need to search to return results of
"From" word along with "To" term but not vice-versa

rust-oleum ; rust-oleum, rust o leum-  this is not working
rust-oleum  ; rust-oleum, rust oleum -  in the analyzer it is showing that rust oleum is replaced
with rust-oleum and then it should show result .
rust-oleum   ;rust-oleum, rust oleum Canada  this will work once above entry works
rust-oleum    ; rust-oleum, rust-oleum Canada   this is working
rust-oleum     ;rust-oleum, rustoleum canada  this is working

eye wash  ;   eye wash, douche occulaire  - this is not working
eye wash  ;   eye wash, douche oculaire - this is working


Gatorade; gatoraid - this is not working . We want to replace to term "gatoraid" with from
term "Gatorade" but output is reversed. When we switch the entry, there is not impact of the
rule

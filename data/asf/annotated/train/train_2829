Hello All,

I created solr cloud instance and collection on Google cloud (Windows
Instance).
I used below command.

*solr create_collection -c booleansearch -shards 1 -replicationFactor 1*


I would like to add one more server to this cloud to have extra documents
indexed and better performance.
Could you please suggest me the steps I need to perform ?

Thanks,
Nilesh Kamani

Hello Jason,

I figured it out:

1) ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient build = new ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient.Builder("http://localhost:8389/solr/core").build();
2) ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient build = new ConcurrentUpdateSolrClient.Builder("http://localhost:8389/solr/core")
				.withQueueSize(20)
				.build();

1) fails with an IllegalArgumentException due to the fact the the queue size is not specified.
2) works as expected.

Cheers,
P.

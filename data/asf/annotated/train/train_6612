Hi ,

I have a situation here where I am required to log the slow queries into a
seperate log file which then can be used for optimization purposes.
For now this log is aggregated into the mainstream log marking
[slow:......].
I looked into the code and the configuration and I am really clueless as to
how do I go about seperating the slow query logs as it needs another file
appender
to be created other than the one already present in the log4j.
If I create another appender I can do so by degregating through log levels
, so that moves all the WARN logs to another file (which is not what I am
looking for).
Also from the code prespective , I feel how about if I introduce another
config setting along with the slowQueryThresholdMillis value , something
like

slowQueryLogFile = get("query/slowQueryLogFile", logfilepath);


where slowQueryLogFile and if present it logs into this file otherwise it
works on the already present along with

slowQueryThresholdMillis = getInt("query/slowQueryThresholdMillis", -1);


or should I tweak log4j ?
I am not sure if anyone has done that before or have any pointers to guide
me on this.
Please help.

Thanks in advance,
Atita

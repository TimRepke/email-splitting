"ant server" should be sufficient. "dist" is useful for when
you have custom _external_ programs (say SolrJ) that you
want all the libraries collected in the same place. There's
no need to "ant compile" as the "server" target

I assume what you're seeing is a ClassNotFound error, right?
I'm a bit puzzled since that filter isn't a contrib, so it should
be found.

What I'd do is just do the build first then start the example,
"bin/solr start -e techproducts"
Don't specify solrhome or anything else. Once that works,
build up from there.

Best,
Erick

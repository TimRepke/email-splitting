This has really nothing to do with SQL. What's happening is that the
query doesn't think you're specifying a field and it's looking for
_text_ which will be defined in your solrconfig file with a "df"
parameter for the query handler.

That said, the query appears malformed or it's a cut/paste error. You
use single quotes to open and a double quote to close:
 'stmt=select fieldA from collection where field='123''
you probably want something like
"stmt=select fieldA from collection where field='123' ''
Best,

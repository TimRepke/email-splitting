Thanks!

Could you do a basic boost query with a list of all those document ids. If they are in results,
their relevance is boosted. If they are not, they are just ignored.

You could have that boost query configured in the solrconfig.xml or passed in by a client.

Regards,

the classic categorization in an e-commerce site (e.g.: Boots, Headgear, etc).  Since this
categorization is different depending on the section/category I cannot easily store which
documents are promoted in Solr itself.  I know ahead of time which documents should be promoted
for which section so I would like to know if there is a way to "pass" these documents to Solr
and have them at the top of the list if they are found in the search results.

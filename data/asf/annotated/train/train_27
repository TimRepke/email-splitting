I am working on changing the log rotation, but looking at the message:

2016-12-21 23:24:41.653 INFO  (qtp110456297-18) [c:sial-catalog-material
s:shard1 r:core_node1 x:sial-catalog-material_shard1_replica1]
o.a.s.c.S.Request [sial-catalog-material_shard1_replica1]  webapp=/solr
path=/cdcr params={qt=/cdcr&action=BOOTSTRAP_STATUS&wt=javabin&version=2}
status=0 QTime=0

I can't tell which class is generating it

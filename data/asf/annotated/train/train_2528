So I have a field named "key" that uses KeywordTokenizer and has
multiValued="true" set. A doc like
<doc>
  <field name="key">val one</field>
  <field name="key">yet another value</field>
  <field name="key">third</field>
</doc>

My field will have exactly three indexed tokens

val one
yet another value
third

Best,
Erick

Thanks for your response, Rick.

The search is based on fields with our custom type "text_en":

I tested it using Solr admin Analysis. It acts as expected. Both huntman's and +huntman's
are divided to huntman's and huntman in index and search:

Index:
SThuntman's
GFhuntman's
WDFhuntman'shuntman
SFhuntman'shuntman
SFhuntman'shuntman
LFhuntman'shuntman
SFhuntman'shuntman
LCFhuntman'shuntman
KSFhuntman'shuntman


Search:
SThuntman's
WDFhuntman'shuntman
LFhuntman'shuntman
LBTShuntman'shuntman
SFhuntman'shuntman
LCFhuntman'shuntman
KSFhuntman'shuntman

BTW, I use Solr 5.3.1

Avi,
Tell us the relevant field types you have in schema.xml.
You can also solve this all for yourself in the Solr Admin Analysis panel.

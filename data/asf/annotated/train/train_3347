Ok, commenting out the "update processor chain" was a solution. I use classic schema.

I was now able to create 365 shards with the 'implicit' router.
In the collection-API call I also specified 
router.field=part_crit 
which is the day of the year 1..365
I added this field in my SQL-statement and in schema.xml.

Next step I thought would be to trigger the dataimport.

However I get:

2017-05-18 05:41:37.417 ERROR (Thread-14) [c:hansi s:308 r:core_node76 x:hansi_308_replica1]

when I start the import.

What could be the reason?

Thank you

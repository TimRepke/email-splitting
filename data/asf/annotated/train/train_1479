The default text field definition (text_general) tokenizes on spaces,
so - if I understand the question correctly - it should just work. Are
you by any chance searching against name field that is defined as
String (and is not tokenized).

If you do Solr tutorial, you search on "ipod", which seems like a
similar case to me. So, can you start from there? You can just index
your own text into the example config for example.

Regards,
   Alex.
P.s. If you are coming from Lucene, copyField instruction may be
slightly confusing. In the examples provided, your text is copied from
named specific fields to text/_text_ field which is actually the
default field searched, using the type definition associated with that
text/_text_ field, rather than with the original field.

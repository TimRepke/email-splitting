I know it works as expected when I set type_s:up as you describe. But I was expecting no children
at all in my query.

In my real query I have a document with several children and thus can't specify a specific
type with childFilter. And I can't give back all children because some of them do not make
any sense at all.
And the problem appears for an intermediate node (which has children and which itself a child
of another).

Hello Fabien,

I believe parentFilter should be type_s:up, and consequently the type_s:up should go in fq.

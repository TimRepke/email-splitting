Further to that. What results do you get when you put those indexed terms into the Analysis
tool on the Solr UI?

Am I correct in assuming that you have the problem searching only when there is a hyphen in
your indexed text? If you, then it would suggest that you need to use a different tokenizer
when indexing - it looks like the hyphen is removed and words each side are concatenated -
hence need both terms to find the text.

Now that I know what to look for in the debugQuery it's becoming more clear. Yes, it's just
searching "text" unless I specify otherwise. More importantly, title searches don't work at
all unless I search on the complete title; words used in the title have no effect. Clearly
I'm doing something wrong.

I've included a link to my schema, and links to some representative queries. 

Solr schema:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz0ceORxyQb9bkFtTERMZTdaWEE

q: University of Wisconsin (no quotes)
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz0ceORxyQb9UlhOMmZtbUxQdTA

q: "University of Wisconsin" (in quotes)
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz0ceORxyQb9NWR0NjZFdmM5WEU

q: title:University
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz0ceORxyQb9X2pfM25CbFNNTmc

q: title:"University of Wisconsin--Madison. Department of Physics | Scientific Biographies"

Subject: Re: Terms not being indexed; not sure why

Most likely you're searching against your default field, often "text".
A frequent problem is that you enter a search like

q=content:University of Wisconsin

and the search is actually

q=content:university text:of text:wisconsin

Try your debug=query with the original maybe?

In fact, somehow you're getting lucky, I'm not sure you you're even
getting a hit when you search by title since the parsed query is:

    "parsedquery": "_text_:21610003",
    "parsedquery_toString": "_text_:21610003",

i.e you're searching against your _text_ field not your filename field.

So my guess is that you're throwing everything in a _text_ field and
always searching against that. Since it's such a "bag of words", it's
just happening to score your query below the top 10.

You'll also want to be boosting the title field, perhaps use edismax.

Best,
Erick

Hi Solr,
I admit the issue you mentioned has not been transparently solved, and
indeed you would need to explicitly use the method=uif to get 4.10.1
behavior.

This is valid if you were using  fc/fcs approaches with high cardinality
fields.

In the case you facet method is enum ( Term Enumeration), the issue has been
transparently solved ( 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-9176 )

Cheers

There is no\nrouting.  There is no capability of automatically managing which\nimplicit shards belong to which logical index.  There's no automatic\nreplication of index data for redundancy.  You're in charge of\n*everything* that SolrCloud would normally handle automatically.\n\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Distributed+Search+with+Index+Sharding\n\nMultiple shards can live in a single Solr instance, whether you use\nSolrCloud or the old way described above.  If your query rate is very\nlow, this probably will perform well.  As the query rate increases, it's\nbest to only have one core per Solr instance.  Either way, it's\n*usually* best to only have one Solr instance per machine.\n\nThanks,\nShawn\n\n\n",

You're committing too frequently, so you have new searchers getting queued
up before the previous ones have been processed.

You have several options on how to deal with this. Can increase commit
interval, add hardware, or reduce query warming.

I don't know if uncommenting that section will help because I don't know
what your current settings are. Or if you are using manual commits.

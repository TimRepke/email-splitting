So i figured out the issue i was facing
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-9803

<updateHandler class="solr.DirectUpdateHandler2">
    <updateLog>
      <str name="dir">${solr.ulog.dir:}</str>
      <int
name="numVersionBuckets">${solr.ulog.numVersionBuckets:8388608}</int>
    </updateLog>


i had a huge value set fir numVersioinBuckets which was causing memory leak
as stated in issue 9803

Changing to default value solved my problem

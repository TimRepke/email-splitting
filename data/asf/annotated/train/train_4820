I know I am missing something very simple here but I cant stop/start my Solr instance with
/opt/solr/bin/solr stop

I get “No Solr nodes found to stop”, however the server is running. I can access the server
via the default port and my app is able to use its services without issue. 


Thanks for any assistance!





Thanks

FWIW, I know mine worked, so maybe try:

<propertyWriter dateFormat="yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
type="SimplePropertiesWriter" />

I can't conceive of what the locale would possibly do when a dateFormat is
specified, so I omitted the attribute. (Maybe one can specify dateFormat
*or *locale--it seems like specifying both would cause a clash.) For what
it's worth, the format you're trying to write seems identical to the
default*, so I'm not sure what benefit you're getting by using that
propertyWriter.

*It's identical to *my* default, anyway. Maybe the default changes based on
one's system configuration, I don't know. This stuff isn't very well
documented.

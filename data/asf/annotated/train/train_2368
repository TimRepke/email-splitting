I'm running two nodes of SolrCloud in Docker on Windows using Docker
Toolbox.  The problem I am having is that Docker Toolbox runs inside of a
VM and so it has an internal network inside the VM that is not accessible
to the Docker Toolbox VM's host OS. If I go to the VM's IP which is
192.168.99.100, I can load the admin UI and do basic operations that are
written to go against that IP and port (like querying, schema editor,
manually adding documents, etc.)

However, when I try to run code that uses SolrJ to add documents, it fails
because the ZK configuration has the IPs for the internal Docker network
which is 172.X.Y..Z. If I log into the toolbox VM and run the Java code
from there, it works just fine. From the host OS, doesn't.

Anyone have any ideas on how to get around this? If I rewrite the indexing
code to do a manual JSON POST to the update handler on one of the nodes, it
does work just fine, but that leaves me not using SolrJ.

Thanks,

Mike

Hi Michael,

I have indexed the documents in such a way,I used OpenNLP to extract named
entities and POS and has indexed these data to respective fields. I have
read(my understanding) that for natural language search using Solr,once you
have the entities extracted the next step is to create a custom query parser
which takes advantage of the entite fields.
I have referred the slides and talk-
https://www.slideshare.net/lucenerevolution/teofilie-natural-languagesearchinsolreurocon2011
<https://www.slideshare.net/lucenerevolution/teofilie-natural-languagesearchinsolreurocon2011>
 
to do the same.

Thanks and Regards,
Arun

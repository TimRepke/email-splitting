1) nope, no big tlog or replaying problem

2) Solr just seem freezed. Not responsive and nothing in the log.
Now I just tried just to restart after the Zookeeper config deploy and on
restart the log complety freezes and the instances don't come up...
If I clean the indexes and then start, this works.
Solr is deployed in Jboss, so I don't know if the stop is too aggressive and
breaks something.

3) No problem at all!

I will continue with some analysis.

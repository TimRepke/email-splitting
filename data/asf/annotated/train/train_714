Hi all,
I developed a custom DocTransformer that is loaded from a .jar in the core
"lib" directory. It works but I have now a problem with versioning:
1. if lib directory contains different versions of the same .jar which one
is loaded? I tried putting both myplugins-1.0.0.jar and myplugins-1.0.1.jar
and I noticed that the oldest one is loaded. Is there a way to force
specific jar version to be loaded in solrconfig?
2. More in general: is it possible to expose in solr the version number for
custom plugins?
Thank you in advance

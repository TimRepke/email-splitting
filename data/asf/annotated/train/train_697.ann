If you were trying to query for 939 or any other value, use this\ninstead:\n\nfq=id:[* TO *]\n\nThis is a range query that will match all documents where the id field\ncontains SOMETHING.  Documents where it is not present will not be\nmatched.  If you do not actually want to *filter* on the id value, then\nyou can simply remove the fq parameter entirely.  Filter queries do not\ncontribute to scoring at all -- they *only* filter.\n\nThe last part of your message says you want documents with an id of 939\nto be listed first.  I think you can do that with this:\n\nbq=id:939^10\n\nThe bq parameter means \"boost query\".  The ^10 part of what I've written\nis the boost value.\n\nThanks,\nShawn\n\n\n",

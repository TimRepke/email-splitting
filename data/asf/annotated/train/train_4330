bq: So, ultimate goal is when the exact query matches in field
one_query, apply boost of one_score

It would have been helpful to have made that statement in the first
place, would have saved some false paths.

What is your analysis chain here? If it's anything like "text_general"
or the like then you're going to have some trouble. I'd think about an
analysis chain like KeywordTokenizerFactory and
LowercaseFilterFactory. That'll index the entire field as a single
token. The admin/analysis page is your friend.

To search against it, you need to _escape_ the space (not "url
escape"). As in google\ cloud so that makes it through the query
parser as a single token.

As of Solr 6.5 you can also specify sow=false (Split On Whitespace),
which may be a better option, see:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-9185

Best,
Erick

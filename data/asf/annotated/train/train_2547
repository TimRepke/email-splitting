Thanks Alex. Yes, I am using TIKA. So, to some extent it preserves the text
flow.

There is something interesting in your reply, "Or you could try using
highlighter to return only 
the sentence. ".

I didnt understand that bit. How do we use Highlighter to return the
sentence?

To make sure, I want to return all sentences where the word "Growth"
appears.

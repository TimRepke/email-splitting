Hi Sergei,

Usually you don't want to know which is which, but you do want to have 
exact matches first. In case of simple queries and depending on your 
usecase, you can use score to make distinction. If "bolter" matches 
"bolt" because of some filters, you will need to index it in two fields 
and boost fields differently to get different score for different matches:

code_text_exact:bolt^10000 OR code_text:bolt

If you want to use wildcards, you can use similar approach:

code_text:bolt^10000 OR code_text:bolt*

HTH,
Emir

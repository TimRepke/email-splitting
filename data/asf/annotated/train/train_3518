The operating system can cache a local filesystem for a infinitely long
time, because no one else is allowed to change the data. With network
filesystems, the operating system can not be sure, that the data have
not been altered by another one. So usually caches on network
filesystems are frequently invalidated.

I think you loose the caching from the OS - memory speed vs. network
filesystem speed! Not sure if mmap helps here ....

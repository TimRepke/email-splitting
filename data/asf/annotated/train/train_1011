Hi Team,

I am new to solr and need your help. My problem statement is as below....

I have uploaded document in solr as below. #sb# represents sentence begining and #se# represents
senetence ending. Now I want to search terms which occur in same sentence .  If I search for
q=text:"Federer Wimbledon" ,  below document should come in search result as both the terms
occur in same senetence. If I search for q=text:"Federer Rafa" ,below document should not
come in search result as the terms occur in different sentences.

#sb#Federer, who looked ahead at Sunday's final, calling it an 'epic battle', said, "Maybe
I lost the Wimbledon final in 2008 because of too many clay court matches #se##sb# He crushed
me at the French Open final #se##sb# I think it affected my first two sets at Wimbledon #se##sb#
Maybe that's why I ended up losing#se##sb# The Swiss continued, "I know Rafa played great
in that final #se##sb# I actually ended up playing great too, but I wasn't fighting the right
way #se##sb# I think that was the effect of that French Open loss. It was more mental #se#
Could you please tell me how to fire query to achieve this.

Thanks
Neeraj

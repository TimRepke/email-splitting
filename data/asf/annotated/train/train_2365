Hi Alex,

After full re-indexing things work out fine.

But is there any other way to make schema changes on the go?

Or we have to reindex entire data whenever a schema change is done?

we are having 30-40 million documents and it is a tedious and time taking
task.

What other approaches are there to change schema on the fly?

Regards,
Kshitij

I have looked at many examples on how to do what I want, but they tend to only show fragments
or they 
are based on older versions of Solr. I'm hoping there are new features that make what I'm
doing easier. 

I am running version 6.5 and am testing by running in cloud mode but only on a single machine.


Basically, I have a large number of documents stored as JSON in individual files. I want to
take that JSON 
document and index it without having to do any pre-processing, etc. I also need to be able
to write newly indexed 
JSON data back to individual files in the same format. 

For example, let's say I have a json document that looks like the following: 

{ 
"id" : "bb903493-55b0-421f-a83e-2199ea11e136", 
"productName_s" : "UsefulWidget", 
"productCategory_s" : "tool", 
"suppliers" : [ 
{ 
"id" : " bb903493-55b0-421f-a83e-2199ea11e221", 
"name_s" : "Acme Tools", 
"productNumber_s" : "10342UW" 
}, { 
"id" : " bb903493-55b0-421a-a83e-2199ea11e445", 
"name_s" : "Snappy Tools", 
"productNumber_s" : "ST-X100023" 
} 
], 
"resellers" : [ 
{ 
"id" : "cc 903493-55b0-421f-a83e-2199ea11e221", 
"name_s" : "Target", 
"productSKU_s" : "TA092310342UW" 
}, { 
"id" : "bc903493-55b0-421a-a83e-2199ea11e445", 
"name_s" : "Wal-Mart", 
"productSKU_s" : "029342ABLSWM" 
} 
] 
} 

I know I can use the /update/json/docs handler to insert the above but from what I understand,
I'd have to set up parameters 
telling it how to split the children, etc. Though that is a bit of a pain, I can make that
happen. 

The problem is that, when I then try to query for the data, it comes back with _childDocuments_
instead of the names of the 
child document lists. So, how can I have Solr return the document as it was originally indexed
(I know it would be embedded 
in the results structure, but I can deal with that)? 

I am running version 6.5 and I am hoping there is a method I haven't seen documented that
can do this. If not, can someone 
point me to some examples of how to do this another way. 

If there is no easy way to do this with the current version, can someone point me to a good
resource for writing my own 
handlers? 

Thank you.

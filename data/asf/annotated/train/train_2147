Hi

Ineed to create afield that will be prefix and suffix with code 
'z01x'.This field needs to have the code in the index and during query.
I can either
1.
have the source data of the field formatted with the code before 
indexing (outside solr).
use a charFilter in the query stage of the field typeto add the 
codeduring query.

<charFilter class="solr.PatternReplaceCharFilterFactory" 
pattern="^(.*)$" replacement="z01x $1 z01x" />

OR

2.
use the charFilter before tokenizerclass during the index and query 
analyzer stage of the field type.

The collection has between 100k - 200k documents currentlybut it may 
increase in the future.
Theindexing time with option 2 and current indexing time is almost the 
same, between 2-3 minutes.

Which option would you advice?

Derek

Hi,

Regarding 'analysis chain':

I'm using Solr 6.4.1, and in the managed-schema file, I find the following:
<fieldType name="text_general" class="solr.TextField"
positionIncrementGap="100" multiValued="true">
    <analyzer type="index">
      <tokenizer class="solr.StandardTokenizerFactory"/>
      <filter class="solr.StopFilterFactory" words="stopwords.txt"
ignoreCase="true"/>
      <filter class="solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory"/>
    </analyzer>
    <analyzer type="query">
      <tokenizer class="solr.StandardTokenizerFactory"/>
      <filter class="solr.StopFilterFactory" words="stopwords.txt"
ignoreCase="true"/>
      <filter class="solr.SynonymFilterFactory" expand="true"
ignoreCase="true" synonyms="synonyms.txt"/>
      <filter class="solr.LowerCaseFilterFactory"/>
    </analyzer>
  </fieldType>


Regarding the Admin UI >> Analysis page:  I just tried that, and to be
honest, I can't seem to get much useful info out of it, especially in terms
of lemmatization.

For example, for any text I enter in it to "analyse", all it does is seem
to tell me which analysers (if that's the right term?) are being used for
the selected field / fieldtype, and for each of these analyzers, it would
give some very basic info, like text, raw_bytes, etc.  Eg, for the input
"united" in the "field value (index)" box, having "text_general" selected
for fieldtype, all I get is this:

ST
text
raw_bytes
start
end
positionLength
type
position
united
[75 6e 69 74 65 64]
0
6
1
<ALPHANUM>
1
SF
text
raw_bytes
start
end
positionLength
type
position
united
[75 6e 69 74 65 64]
0
6
1
<ALPHANUM>
1
LCF
text
raw_bytes
start
end
positionLength
type
position
united
[75 6e 69 74 65 64]
0
6
1
<ALPHANUM>
1
Placing the mouse cursor on "ST", "SF", or "LCF" shows a tooltip saying
"org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardTokenizer",
"org...core.StopFilter", and "org...core.LowerCaseFilter", respectively.


So - should 'states' not be lemmatized to 'state' using these settings?
 (If not, then I would need to figure out how to use a different lemmatizer)

Thanks

Hi,


I indexed documents in Solr using dataImportHandler.

Now when I want to query using the below URL, it gives me the results i want.


http://localhost:8983/solr/mycore/select?indent=on&q=id:7fd326e23ffa8d1cb9c0a7b4fc5c4269&wt=json


Can Solr handle bulk queries if I send over more than 10,000 ids in the query and get their
result instead of sending 1 id each time to solr-server ?


I am using Solr-5.2.1

Any pointers would help.



Thanks!

Then the second copy of the new shards are created on other\nnodes which may or may not be the same node that the original follower\nreplica was located on.\n\nHow does solr determine where to put the new follower replicas, and is\nthere a way to prevent it from colocating the leader and the follower of\nthe new shards?\n\nThanks,\nChris\n\n",

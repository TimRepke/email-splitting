Hello All,

Sorry to bother you all again. I am having hard time understanding solr
terminologies.

Is there any step by step guide to create solr cloud in Solr 6.x ?

I have two servers on my google cloud and have installed solr on both of
them.

I would like to create one collection, shard1 on server1, shard2 on
server2, (replicas).

I want to index few GBs of documents on Shard1/Server1 and few GBs
documents on Shard2/Server1.

Could you please point me to a link or video ?

Thanks,
Nilesh Kamani

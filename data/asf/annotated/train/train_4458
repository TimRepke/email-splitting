Hi Erick,

Initially I also thought of using Streaming for Joins. But looks like Joins
with Streaming is not for heavy QPS sort of queries and that's my use case. 
Currently things are working fine with normal join for us as we have only
one shard. But in coming days number of documents to be indexed is going to
be increased drastically. So we need to split shards. The time I split
shards I can't use Joins.

We thought of going with Implict routing for sharding. But if we go with
Implicit routing, all indexing will not be distributed and so one shard
could be getting more load which we don't want. 
So we badly looking for default Join.
As I have posted in different questions in this forum itself and you too
have replied.... our joins are between real documents and it's ACL
documents. ACL document has multi value field whose value would be user or
groups. Why we want to keep ACL separately instead of keeping it in same
real document itself. It's because that our ACL can grow till 1L of users or
even more. and for every change in ACL or its permission we don't want to
re-index the real document as well. 

Do you think is there any better alternative ? or the way we have kept ACLs
are wrong ? 

Regards,

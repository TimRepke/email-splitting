But in coming days number of documents to be indexed is going to\nbe increased drastically. So we need to split shards. The time I split\nshards I can't use Joins.\n\nWe thought of going with Implict routing for sharding.

ACL document has multi value field whose value would be user or\ngroups. Why we want to keep ACL separately instead of keeping it in same\nreal document itself. It's because that our ACL can grow till 1L of users or\neven more. and for every change in ACL or its permission we don't want to\nre-index the real document as well. \n\nDo you think is there any better alternative ? or the way we have kept ACLs\nare wrong ? \n\nRegards,\n\n\n\n--\nView this message in context: http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/Allow-Join-over-two-sharded-collection-tp4343443p4343582.html\nSent from the Solr - User mailing list archive at Nabble.com.\n\n",

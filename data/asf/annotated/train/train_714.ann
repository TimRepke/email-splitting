It works but I have now a problem with versioning:\n1. if lib directory contains different versions of the same .jar which one\nis loaded? I tried putting both myplugins-1.0.0.jar and myplugins-1.0.1.jar\nand I noticed that the oldest one is loaded. Is there a way to force\nspecific jar version to be loaded in solrconfig?\n2. More in general: is it possible to expose in solr the version number for\ncustom plugins?\nThank you in advance\n\n",

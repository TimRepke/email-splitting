Hi all,

Very pleased to announce the first release of Marple, an open source 
tool for inspecting Lucene indexes. We've blogged about it here:
http://www.flax.co.uk/blog/2017/02/24/release-1-0-marple-lucene-index-detective/
which contains links to the code and released JAR.

This is very much a work in progress (we started it at the Lucene 
hackday we ran in London last autumn) so contributions, bug reports & 
feature requests very welcome! We'll also be talking about it at the 
next London Lucene/Solr Meetup on March 23rd.

Best

Charlie

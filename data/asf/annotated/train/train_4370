Sure, someone changed the system variable "solr.install.dir" (i.e.
-Dsolr.install.dir=some other place). Or removed it. Or changed the
startup script. Or....

I've gotten very skeptical of "we didn't change anything but suddenly
it stopped working". Usually it's something someone's changed
unbeknownst to the person you're interacting with.

The solr log usually shows the paths where everything gets loaded
from. You should be able to track where Solr is looking for all its
resources.

It's also possible one of the jars was corrupted on disk (disks do go bad).

So you can also inspect the jars to see if that class. Here's a way to
look for one:

find . -name '*jar' -exec bash -c 'jar tvf {} | grep
ParserDiscoveryAnnotation' \; -print

where ParserDiscoveryAnnotation is the class you're not finding.

Best,
Erick

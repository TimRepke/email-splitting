Is this visible in the logs? I mean how do I find out that a "DELETE
collection" APIâ€‹ call was made?

Is the following indicative of the fact that the API call was made?

2017-01-20 20:42:39,822 INFO org.apache.solr.cloud.
ShardLeaderElectionContextBase: Removing leader registration node on
cancel: /collections/3044_01_17/leaders/shard4/leader 9

2017-01-20 20:42:39,832 INFO org.apache.solr.cloud.ElectionContext:

2017-01-20 20:42:39,833 INFO org.apache.solr.common.cloud.ZkStateReader:
Removing watch for uninteresting collection [3044_01_17]

  "core":"3044_01_17_shard4_replica1",

  "collection":"3044_01_17",


I am confused as the logs just talk about shard4 not all the shards of the
collection.

Thanks for replying Shawn,

There was an issue with the db connection url, silly mistake.

I am facing one another problem, do not know if should post in the same
thread or as a new post. Anyways posting here only, let me know if needs to
be posted as new one.

I am using DIH as you know. I have property_id as a unique key and I have i
parent and 14-15 child entities(trying to improve performance for pretty old
system hence can't avoid/reduce so many childs).
We have around 2.5 lacs ids in DB. So full import is becoming kind of near
impossible for me here. I tried to split this into multiple document files
within the same core and added a new data import handler as well. but when I
am running import on both urls. The latest data import overrides the
previous one, hence I am not able to get complete data.

So I have 2 questions here.

1. Is there a better way of doing indexing and import than the way I am
doing it right now?
2. if no, then how can I make full import faster here?

If you're running standalone (not SolrCloud), then everything having to
do with shards must be 100 percent managed by you.  There is no
routing.  There is no capability of automatically managing which
implicit shards belong to which logical index.  There's no automatic
replication of index data for redundancy.  You're in charge of
*everything* that SolrCloud would normally handle automatically.

Multiple shards can live in a single Solr instance, whether you use
SolrCloud or the old way described above.  If your query rate is very
low, this probably will perform well.  As the query rate increases, it's
best to only have one core per Solr instance.  Either way, it's
*usually* best to only have one Solr instance per machine.

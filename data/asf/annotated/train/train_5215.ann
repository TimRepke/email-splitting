In a series of 10\nrequests for the specific document across a few minute timespan, one of the\nmiddle requests returned a null document.\n\nCurrently, nothing is updating existing records in the collection, so it\ncouldn't have actually been deleted.\n\nThe test cloud and collection have 3 nodes, 6 shards, and 1 replica per\nshard. Based on the fact that the node that was queried was not the node\nthe document resided on, I assume that there may have been a temporary\nconnectivity issue that we're unaware of and the request couldn't find the\ndocument and returned null.\n\nSo is that a possibility, and are there any other circumstances where the\n/get handler would not be able to return a document that exists in a\ncollection?\n\nThanks,\nChris\n\n",

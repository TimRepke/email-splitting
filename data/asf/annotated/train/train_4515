With 8GB of RAM and 5.5 GB of Java memory, there is zero room for caching indexes. The OS will
eat a gigabyte or so, then there are other processes running. So either the index accesses
are pounding on the disk or the Java heap is getting swapped out.

This machine is too small. The smallest Solr machine we deploy, even in test and dev, has
15 GB of RAM, SSD disks, and has an 8 GB Java heap. In prod, we run with enough RAM that the
entire index can live in RAM file buffers.

We donâ€™t do a lot of faceting or other memory-intensive queries. We mostly just search.

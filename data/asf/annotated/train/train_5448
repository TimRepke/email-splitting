Hi !


I've a Lucene base coming from a C++ program linked with Lucene++, a
port of Lucene 3.5.9. When I open this base with Luke, it show Lucene
2.9. Can see a binary field I have in Luke, with data encoded in
base64.


I have upgrade this base from 2.9 => 4.0 => 5.0 =>6.0 so I can use it
with Solr 6.5.1. I rebuild a schema for this base, who have one field
in binary:


<field name="document" type="binary" indexed="false" stored="true"/>


When I try to retrieve this field with a query (with SOLR admin
interface) it's fail with "can not use FieldCache on a field which is
neither indexed nor has doc values: document"


I can retrieve others fields, but can't find a way for this one. Does
someone have an idea ? (At the end I want do this with php, but as it
fail with Solr interface too ....).

Thank you for any help !

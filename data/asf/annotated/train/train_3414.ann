Since it's such a \"bag of words\", it's\njust happening to score your query below the top 10.\n\nYou'll also want to be boosting the title field, perhaps use edismax.\n\nBest,\nErick\n\nOn Mon, May 15, 2017 at 1:17 PM, Susheel Kumar <susheel2777@gmail.com> wrote:\n> Can you upload your schema to some site like dropbox etc. to look and send\n> the query which you are using and returning no results?\n>\n> Thanks,\n> Susheel\n>\n> On Mon, May 15, 2017 at 1:46 PM, Chip Calhoun <ccalhoun@aip.org> wrote:\n>\n>> I'm creating a new Solr core to crawl a local site.

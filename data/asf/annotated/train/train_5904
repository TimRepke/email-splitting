Hi, I have a custom field "listOfIDs" = "1,2,4,33"

I want the equivalent of:

select * where '1' IN (listOfIDs)  --> should get a match

select * where '33' IN (listOfIDs)  --> should get a match

select * where '3' IN (listOfIDs)  --> should NOT get a match


Can anyone help me out please as I can't seem to find any documentation on
this. Thanks very much in advance.

Kind regards,


Nick Way

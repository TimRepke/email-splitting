The issue has been fixed. Seems there is a problem in *solr/core/ivy.xml *

<dependency org="commons-fileupload" name="commons-fileupload"
rev="${/commons-fileupload/commons-fileupload}" conf="compile"/>

In this line, I replaced the ${/commons-fileupload/commons-fileupload} with
1.3.2 as the variable seemed to be downloading version 1.3.1 of the
commons-fileupload instead of the latest 1.3.2 version.

Once this was done, ant built the sources successfully.

Thanks!

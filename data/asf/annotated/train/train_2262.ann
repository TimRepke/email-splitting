So both in the Field Value (Query) and\nField Value (Index) the WordDelimiterFilterFactory is converting the word\n'Bachelor's Degree' to 'Bachelor's Degree' , SO why I am getting zero\nresults when quering. I have attached the screenshots of my analysis page.\n\n\nI have attached a code file 'code.txt' where you can see the code for the\nfield 'body'.\n\n\nPlease tell me what Am I doing wrong.\n\nThanks\n\n-- \n*CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This e-mail transmission, and any documents, files \nor previous e-mail messages attached to it, are confidential and may be \nprivileged.

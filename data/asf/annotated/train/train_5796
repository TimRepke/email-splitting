Hi Markus,

I don't know what Client you use, but if you are using SolrJ enabling the 
logging could be an option to "dig deeper" into the problem. This can be 
the ouput for example via log4j on log level info:

...

connectString=ZKHOST1:9983,ZKHOST2:9983,ZKHOST3:9983,ZKHOST4:9983,ZKHOST5:9983

Hello Stephan,

I know that restarting stuff can sometimes cure what's wrong, but we are 
nog going to, we want to get rid of the problem, not restart microsoft 
windows whenever things run slow. Also, there is no indexing going on 
right now.

We also see these sometimes, this explains at least why it cannot talk to 
Zookeeper, but why..
 o.a.s.c.RecoveryStrategy Socket timeout on send prep recovery cmd, 
retrying.. 

This has been going on with just one of our nodes for over two hours, 
other nodes are fine. And why is this bad node green in cluster overview?

Thanks,
Markus

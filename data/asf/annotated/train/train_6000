Just wondering if anyone has seen this before and might understand why this is happening

When we deploy a new schema.xml adding some new search terms we get the dreaded “IndexWriter
is closed” exception and the only solution we have found to date is a Solr restart :-(

Environment:

  *   Solr 5.3.1 in Solr Cloud (3 shards each with 3 replicas across 3 EC2 Vms)
  *   300m+ documents (60+ GB index)
  *   Relevant settings?
     *   SOLR_OPTS="$SOLR_OPTS -Dsolr.autoSoftCommit.maxTime=1000”
     *   SOLR_OPTS="$SOLR_OPTS -Dsolr.autoCommit.maxTime=300000"

Is there anything “unsafe” about reload on a collection that is handling live traffic?
Could be related to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-9830
And https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-9699 in particular?

Cheers!

-Frank

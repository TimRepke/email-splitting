Thanks.
Both of these are working in my case:
name:"tv promotion"   -->  name:"tv promotion"
name:tv AND name:promotion --> name:tv AND name:promotion
(Although I'm assuming, the first might not have worked if my document had
been say 'promotion tv' or 'tv xyz promotion')

However, these are returning only those documents which have both the terms
'tv promotion' in them (there are a few).  It's not returning any document
which have only 'tv' or only 'promotion' in them.

That's not an absolute requirement of mine, I could work around it, but I
was just wondering, if it were possible to pass a single solr query with
both the terms 'tv' and 'promotion' in them, and have them return all the
documents which contain either of those terms, but with higher scores
attached to those documents with both those terms?

Much thanks

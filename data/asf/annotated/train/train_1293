first of all I apologize for the length of this message ... there are few
questions I would appreciate your help please:

1. originally I wanted to use solrj in my application layer (webapp deployed
with tomcat), to query the solr server(s) with multi-cores, non-cloud setup.

Since I need send back XML format to my client, I realize it is not an use
case for solrj, so I should abandon the idea (correct?)

2. I also looked into CommonsHttpSolrServer trying to query solr directly,
which supposedly allow me to set XMLResponseParser as  ResponseParser. 
however, it seems CommonsHttpSolrServer is deprecated, with httpclient 4.x I
think I should use HttpSolrServer. I do need to have a way to set the
returned data in xml format, and I want to use pooled http conn manager to
support multiple thread for queries. I thought I could do all this with
HttpSolrServer, (yes?) as below:

PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager connManager = new
PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager(); 
connManager.setMaxTotal(5);
connManager.setDefaultMaxPerRoute(4);
... ...
CloseableHttpClient httpclient =
HttpClients.custom().setConnectionManager(connManager).build();
... ...
ResponseParser parser = new XMLResponseParser();
... ...
HttpSolrServer server = new HttpSolrServer(myUrl, httpclient, parser);

... ... 
SolrQuery query = new SolrQuery();
query.setQuery(q);
query.setParam("wt", "xml"); // not needed?
... ...
QueryResponse response = server.query(query);
SolrDocumentList sdl = response.getResults();

at this point will the documents in sdl be in xml format if I use toString()
looping through them? will there be overhead if this works at all? will
solrj skip the xml parsing and simply return the results as I requested xml
parser?

I somehow feel its very fishy and I could be better off just not use solrj ?
what is the best practice here?

3. I think my next question could be more like a httpclient question, but it
does relate to solr / cores, so I will hope someone can give me help here:

when I try to config PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager, for the per route
connection etc, will the following different url considered to be different
routes, or since they hit the same server, it will ignore the
collection/core part?

String myUrl = "http://localhost:8983/solr/core1";

and

String myUrl = "http://localhost:8983/solr/core2";


Thanks!
Renee

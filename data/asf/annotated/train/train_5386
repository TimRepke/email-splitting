Hi,
we are updating our SOLR infrastructure from version 4.10.2 to the latest 6.6. 
We realize a significant degradation of the response time while running match-all queries
with facets (query in [1]) With version 4.x these kind of queries never took longer than 2000
ms.
Now all of these queries need more than 9000 ms. 
Our index [2] [3] contains around 30 Mio docs. Because we want to use doc-values for facets
and sort functions we changed our doc-processing significantly replacing all text type with
string fields.
The behavior of normal term queries is acceptable although it's a little bit slower compared
with the current productive environment. Yesterday I run a couple of performance tests
I looked around and came across this (older) issue [4] which is partially related to our observations
but actually I cannot find a solution for our behavior.
Did we miss something on the way of the development from version 4 / 5 / 6 which might be
the reason for the degradation and we should change our queries?
Thanks a lot for any hints
GÃ¼nter

Hello All,

I am working on a requirement to index field of type JSON (in mongoDB
collection) in SOLR 5.4.0.

I am using mongo-jdbc-dih which I found on GitHub :

https://github.com/hrishik/solr-mongodb-dih

However I could not find a fieldtype on Apache SOLR wiki page which would
support JSON datatype in mongoDB.

Can someone please recommend a way to include datatype / fieldtype in SOLR
schema to support or index JSON data field from mongoDB.
Thanks.

R​egards,

Abhijit​

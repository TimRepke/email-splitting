Currently Data is processed by R and it pushes the data to Solr using a R package called Solrium.
I'm running a webserver which has banana to visualize the events.

R re-formats the event created time to "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:sss'Z'". And if I process the timezone
to UTC (substracting 8 hours in my case) and send to Solr, banana dashboard shows data properly,
but I have to again add 8 hours in banana dashboard. This was not the case with solr 5.5.1.
 Solr handling timezone is causing lot of confusing, initially thinking event took place in
wrong time.

Regards,
Adline

What are your autocommit settings? Are you waiting for that interval
to expire? Does the doc ever show up?

What leads you to suspect "timezone changes in 6x"? Solr tries to be
timezone-agnostic so this would be a surprise.

Few queries which works on 5.x fails to work on 6.x. and I assume its related to timezone
changes in 6.x.

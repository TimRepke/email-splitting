Hello, community!
Did you manage to recognize jpf,tiff or whatever with cyrillics text inside?
Ive got only latin letter (looks like ugly translite text) in result for
that moment.For image contains only lattin letters it works fine.
Does anyone have any suggestion, best practice or case studies refer to
this situation?

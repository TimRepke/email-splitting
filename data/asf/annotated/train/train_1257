By default its 10 rows on Admin UI and indeed its gray. But did you tried writing a number
into the text field for:
Start,rows. See the screen shots attached.

    Hello,
    
    In the browser-based Solr Admin, in the 'Query' page, the "start" and
    "rows" input boxes have default values of 0 and 10 respectively, but these
    values are grayed out the input boxes are not allowing me to change their
    values.  Therefore, whenever I submit a query on this page, I am only ever
    able to see the first 10 rows.  How can I see more rows / results?
    
    Thanks

Hi Can,

For your first question: you should share more information with us as Rick
indicated. Do you have any errors, do you have unique ids or not etc?

For the second one: you should read here:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Spatial+Search and ask
your questions if you have any.

Kind Regards,
Furkan KAMACI

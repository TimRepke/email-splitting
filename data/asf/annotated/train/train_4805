The included scripts already run Solr in the background.  I don't know
if that's enough to call it a daemon, but it's pretty close even if it's
not technically accurate.

Solr almost never *crashes*.  I've never seen it happen, and I've been
using Solr for seven years.  Typically if a Solr process were to
actually crash, it would be caused by a problem with Java itself, a
problem with the local Solr installation, or a problem with the
operating system.

Modern Solr versions (if running on non-Windows systems) *do* kill
themselves if an OutOfMemoryError exception occurs ... but if that
happens, you do not want to automatically restart Solr -- you need to
figure out why the OOME happened and fix it.  After a Java program
encounters OOME, it is completely unpredictable and can destroy its
data.  If the OOME was not caused by an atypical query, it is almost
guaranteed to happen again.

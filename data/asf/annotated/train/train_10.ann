Collection \ndata is left in the clusterstate.json file in ZooKeeper and no \ncollections can be created anymore until this entry gets removed. I can \nreproduce this on Solr 6.2.1 and 6.3, while 6.3 seems to be somewhat \nless likely to get stuck. Is Solr supposed to recover from data being \nstuck in the clusterstate.json at some point? I had one instance where \nit looked like data was removed again but normally the data does not \nseem to get cleaned up automatically and just blocks any further \ncollection creations.\n\nI did not find anything like this in Jira. Just SOLR-7198 sounds a bit \nsimilar even though it is about deleting collections.\n\nregards,\nHendrik\n\n",

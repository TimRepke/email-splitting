That's a good point Alex, about indexed vs stored. Since all my queries are
exact match, I can just have them stored=false to save space. I believe
that helps since there are billions of rows and it'll hopefully save on
quite some of space.
But nothing can be done for squeezing dates in same document right?

Thanks for the reply.

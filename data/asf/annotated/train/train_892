hi Shawn,

as I replied to Markus, of course I know (and use) the collections api to
reload the config. I am asking what would happen in that scenario:
 - config updated (but collection not reloaded)
 - i restart one node
now one node has the new config and the rest the old one??

To which he already replied:
>The restared/reloaded node has the new config, the others have the old
config until reloaded/restarted.

I was not asking about making solr restart itself, my English must be worst
than I thought. By the way, stuff like that can be achieved with
http://yajsw.sourceforge.net/ a very powerful java wrapper, I used to use
it when Solr did not have a built in daemon setup. It was built by someone
how was using JSW, and got pissed when that one went commercial. It is very
configurable, but of course more complex. I wrote something about it some
time ago

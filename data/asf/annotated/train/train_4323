Have you looked at ComplexPhraseQueryParser? It adds  some expense of

and found that, yes, each work. However, what does not seem to work is both together. That
is, looking for words or phrases near each other seems to work and looking for truncated words
like pregna* seems to work, but the two together in one search string do not. Does anyone
have experience in the Drupal context that could give me some advice or point me to a resource
that can?

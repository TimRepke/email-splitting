All,

Is there possiblity in near future in coming new releases, adding shards
dynamically though compositeId ( default ) based routing is used.
Currently only option is we need to split the shard, instead we should able
to add shards dynamically and then on all new documents should go on new
shards.
Is there a plan to include this in coming release(s) ?

Regards,
Ganesh

Hi all.

I need to implement an indexation solution where my Solr index doesn't get a
wrong version.
Due to the fact I have many version for the same entity In some cases my
client may end up indexing an earlier version of my entity after a newer
one.

I was wondering if I can use the _version_ field where I send always the
timespam of last update to the entity.

Is this going to reject earlier versions if a newer is already indexed?

Thanks,
Sergio

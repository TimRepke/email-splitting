This most likely means that you've got duplicate documents in different
shards of your cloud.  This most commonly happens when the router is
"implicit" which is easier to understand if you imagine that "implicit"
is "manual" -- which would be a far better name for it.

In a later message you mention duplicate documents and 3 shards.  It
sounds like you have indexed all your documents to all three shards, and
are probably using the implicit router.

The implicit router basically means that there *IS* no shard routing --
documents would be either indexed by the shard that received them, or
directed to the shard indicated by explicit routing parameters.  With
three shards and "distrib=false" requests to one shard, you should see
about one-third of your total document count, not the full document count.

The router that you typically want if you don't want to be concerned
about how documents are routed to different shards is the compositeId
router.  This *should* be the default for a multi-shard collection in
any recent version, but the first one or two releases of SolrCloud might
have created the wrong type.

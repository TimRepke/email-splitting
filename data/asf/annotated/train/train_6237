That's what I ended up doing too, for my MariaDB (MySQL derivative) DB:

CONVERT_TZ('${dataimporter.last_index_time}','${user.timezone}','${
custom.dataimporter.datasource.tz}')

user.timezone is Solr's time zone and custom.dataimporter.datasource.tz is
a property I set on startup.

The other option was to change Solr's timezone to match the DB, but I
thought that was even more of a hack.

Hello all,

I would like to bring to your attention the (long overdue) release of a new
version of TensorFrames. Thank you to all people who have reported some
packaging and installation issues. This release fixes a large number of
performance and stability problems, and brings a few improvements.

As an example, following this notebook [1], you can distribute the
classification of images using Spark, TensorFlow and the Inception V3 model
from google. It is published as a Databricks notebook and it has been
tested on Jupyter as well.

What is TensorFrames?
TensorFrames (TensorFlow on Spark Dataframes) lets you manipulate Spark's
DataFrames with TensorFlow programs.

Spark package:

Release notes:

Best regards

Tim Hunter

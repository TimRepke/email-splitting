hi guys,


an uber/fat jar file has been created to run with spark in CDH yarc client
mode.

As usual job is submitted to the edge node.

does the jar file has to be placed in the same directory ewith spark is
running in the cluster to make it work?

Also what will happen if say out of 9 nodes running spark, 3 have not got
the jar file. will that job fail or it will carry on on the fremaing 6
nodes that have that jar file?

thanks

Dr Mich Talebzadeh

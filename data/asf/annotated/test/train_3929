Hi,

I am using Apache spark 2.0.2 randomforest ml (standalone mode) for text
classification. TF-IDF feature extractor is also used. The training part
runs without any issues and returns 100% accuracy. But when I am trying to
do prediction using trained model and compute test error, it fails with
java.util.NosuchElementException: key not found exception.
Any help will be much appreciated.

Thanks

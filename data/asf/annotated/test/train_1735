Hi Soumitra,
We're working on that. The Idea here is to use Kafka to get brokers'
information of the topic and use Kafka client to find coresponding offsets
on new cluster (
https://jeqo.github.io/post/2017-01-31-kafka-rewind-consumers-offset/). You
need kafka >=0.10.1.0 because it supports timestamp-based index.

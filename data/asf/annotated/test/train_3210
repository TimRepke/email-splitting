Well there are few things here.

1. What is the Spark Version?
2. You said there is OOM error but what is the cause that appears in the
log message or stack trace? OOM can happen for various reasons and JVM
usually specifies the cause in the error message.
3. What is the driver and executor memory?
4. What is the receive throughput per second and what is the data size of
an average message?
5. What OS you are using ?

StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER_2 This means that after the receiver
receives the data is replicated across worker nodes.

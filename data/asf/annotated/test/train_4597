    Hello,<br>
    <br>
    I recently came across the "--driver-cores" option when, for
    example, launching a PySpark shell.<br>
    <br>
    Provided that there are idle CPUs on driver's node, what would be
    the benefit of having multiple driver cores? For example, will this
    accelerate the "collect()" operations? Will they be done in
    parallel?<br>
    <br>
    Can't find any documentation about how the behavior will change from
    using just 1 core for the driver.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks in advance.<br>
    <br>
    Judit<br>

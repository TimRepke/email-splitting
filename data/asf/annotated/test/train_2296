Hi all,

I was submitting the play application to spark 2.1 standalone cluster . In
play application postgres dependency is also added and application works on
local spark libraries. But at run time on standalone cluster it gives me
error : 

o.a.s.s.TaskSetManager - Lost task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 1, 172.31.21.3,
executor 1): java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.postgresql
.Driver

I have placed following in spark-defaults.conf directory

spark.executor.extraClassPath  
/home/ubuntu/downloads/postgres/postgresql-9.4-1200-jdbc41.jar
spark.driver.extraClassPath    
/home/ubuntu/downloads/postgres/postgresql-9.4-1200-jdbc41.jar

Still executors unable to pick the driver. 
Am i missing something? Need help . 
Thanks.

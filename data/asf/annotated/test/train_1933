Hi,

Will MongoDB not fit this solution?

Hi Muthu,.

I did not catch from your message, what performance do you expect from subsequent queries?

Hello Uladzimir / Shiva,

From ElasticSearch documentation (i have to see the logical plan of a query to confirm), the
richness of filters (like regex,..) is pretty good while comparing to Cassandra. As for aggregates,
i think Spark Dataframes is quite rich enough to tackle.
Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Muthu

Hi muthu,

I agree with Shiva, Cassandra also supports SASI indexes, which can partially replace Elasticsearch
functionality.

Probably Cassandra is a good choice if you are mainly looking for a datastore that supports
fast writes. You can ingest the data into a table and define one or more materialized views
on top of it to support your queries. Since you mention that your queries are going to be
simple you can define your indexes in the materialized views according to how you want to
query the data.
Thanks,
Shiva

Hello Vincent,

Cassandra may not fit my bill if I need to define my partition and other indexes upfront.
Is this right?

Hello Richard,

Let me evaluate Apache Ignite. I did evaluate it 3 months back and back then the connector
to Apache Spark did not support Spark 2.0.

Another drastic thought may be repartition the result count to 1 (but have to be cautions
on making sure I don't run into Heap issues if the result is too large to fit into an executor)
 and write to a relational database like mysql / postgres. But, I believe I can do the same
using ElasticSearch too.

A slightly over-kill solution may be Spark to Kafka to ElasticSearch?

More thoughts welcome please.

Thanks,
Muthu

Hi
If queries are statics and filters are on the same columns, Cassandra is a good option.

a Ã©crit :
Hello there,

I have one or more parquet files to read and perform some aggregate queries
using Spark Dataframe. I would like to find a reasonable fast datastore that
allows me to write the results for subsequent (simpler queries).
I did attempt to use ElasticSearch to write the query results using
ElasticSearch Hadoop connector. But I am running into connector write issues
if the number of Spark executors are too many for ElasticSearch to handle.
But in the schema sense, this seems a great fit as ElasticSearch has smartz
in place to discover the schema. Also in the query sense, I can perform
simple filters and sort using ElasticSearch and for more complex aggregate,
Spark Dataframe can come back to the rescue :).
Please advice on other possible data-stores I could use?

Thanks,
Muthu

Hello!

I am running Spark on Java and bumped into a problem I can't solve or find
anything helpful among answered questions, so I would really appreciate
your help.

I am running some calculations, creating rows for each result:

List<Row> results = new LinkedList<Row>();

for(something){
results.add(RowFactory.create( someStringVariable, someIntegerVariable ));
         }

Now I ended up with a list of rows I need to turn into dataframe to perform
some spark sql operations on them, like groupings and sorting. Would like
to keep the dataTypes.

I tried:

Dataset<Row> toShow = spark.createDataFrame(results, Row.class);

but it throws nullpointer. (spark being SparkSession) Is my logic wrong
there somewhere, should this operation be possible, resulting in what I
want?
Or do I have to create a custom class which extends serializable and create
a list of those objects rather than Rows? Will I be able to perform SQL
queries on dataset consisting of custom class objects rather than rows?

I'm sorry if this is a duplicate question.
Thank you for your help!

Karin

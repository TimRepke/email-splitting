Can multiple DStreams manipulate a state? I have a stream that gives me
total minutes the user spent on a course material. I have another stream
that gives me chapters completed and lessons completed by the user. I want
to keep track for each user total_minutes, chapters_completed and
lessons_completed. I am not sure if I should have 1 state or 2 states. Can
I lookup the state for a given key just like a map outside the mapfunction?

Appreciate your input. Thanks

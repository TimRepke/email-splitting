 further to this, if you try the following notebook in databricks cloud, it
will read a .csv file , write to a parquet file and read it again (just to
count the number of rows stored)
Please note that the path to the csv file might differ for you.....
So, what you will need todo is
1 - create an account to community.cloud.databricks.com
2 - upload the .csv file onto the Data of your databricks private cluster
3  - run the script. that will store the data on the distrubuted filesystem
of the databricks cloudn (dbfs)

It's worth investing in this free databricks cloud as it can create a
cluster for you with minimal effort, and it's  a very easy way to test your
spark scripts on a real cluster

hope this helps

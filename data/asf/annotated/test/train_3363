Dear all,

I would appreciate if anyone could explain when does mapWithState terminate, i.e. apply subsequent
transformations such as writing the state to an external sink? 

Given a KafkaConsumer instance pulling messages from a Kafka topic, and a mapWithState transformation
updating the state given a certain key, the subsequent foreachRDD transformation is not being
applied at all. However, when running the application in debug mode using a sufficiently small
input data size, of for example a few thousand messages, the foreachRDD transformation is
applied upon consumption of all messages. Is this the desired behaviour? Does the timeout
interval of the mapWithState control this behaviour, and if yes, what is the default value?
In addition, is there an alternative in updating state for a given key, and writing the output
to within the foreachRDD/foreachPartition transformation every n seconds?

Thanks in advance,
Dominik

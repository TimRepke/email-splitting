Hi All,

I was wondering if we need to checkpoint both read and write streams when
reading from Kafka and inserting into a target store?

for example

sparkSession.readStream().option("checkpointLocation", "hdfsPath").load()

vs

dataSet.writeStream().option("checkpointLocation", "hdfsPath")

Thanks!

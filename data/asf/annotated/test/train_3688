Hi everyone

Currently GBT doesn't expose featureSubsetStrategy as exposed by Random
Forest.

.
GradientBoostedTrees in Spark have hardcoded feature subset strategy to
"all" while calling random forest in  DecisionTreeRegressor.scala

val trees = RandomForest.run(data, oldStrategy, numTrees = 1,
featureSubsetStrategy = "all",


It should provide functionality to the user to set featureSubsetStrategy
("auto", "all" ,"sqrt" , "log2" , "onethird") ,
the way random forest does.

This will help GBT to have randomness at feature level.

Jira SPARK-20199 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20199>

Please let me know , if my understanding is correct.

Regards
Pralabh Kumar
